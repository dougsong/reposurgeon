			rs - a repository surgeon

eposurgeon enables risky operations that version-control systems don't
want to let you do, such as (a) editing past comments and metadata,
(b) excising commits, (c) coalescing commits, and (d) removing files
and subtrees from repo history. The original motivation for
reposurgeon was to clean up artifacts created by repository
conversions.

To test the correctness of this software, change to the 'test' subdirectory
and type 'make'.
