= Reposurgeon Designer's Notes =
Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>

The purpose of reposurgeon is to enable risky operations that version-control
systems don't want to let you do, such as (a) editing past comments and 
metadata, (b) excising commits, and (c) coalescing commits. The motivation
for reposurgeon was to help with artifacts and sca r tisue created by 
repository conversions.

The reposurgeon tool depends on being able to map all the version-control
systems it knows about into a common data model.  Here are the components 
of the model:

1. A sequence of commit objects.  The primary key for these objects is
the date of the commit. Each commit represents an ebtire state of
some file tree.

2. A map of the is-a-parent-of relationship. A commit may have multiplre 
parents; the map implies a DAG (directed acyclic graph) of commits.

3. A list of branch heads.  This is a mapping from names to tip 
revisions in the DAG.

4. A list of tags (name-to-commit mappings).

This model is intended to capture the common semantics of distributed
version-control systems: the three specific tarhets are git, hg, and
Subversion (more may be added in future).

It is a design constraint that all reposurgeon operations either prserve
all VCS-specific metadata thety are not told to modify or warn you when
they cannot.

= Reposurgeon Theory of Operation =
Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>

The purpose of reposurgeon is to enable risky operations that
version-control systems don't want to let you do, such as (a) editing
past comments and metadata, (b) excising commits, (c) coalescing
commits, and (d) removing files and subtrees from repo history. The
original motivation for reposurgeon was to clean up artifacts
created by repository conversions.

To keep reposurgeon simple and flexible, it does not do its own
repository reading and writing.  Instead, it relies on being able to
parse and emit the dump format created by git-fast-export and read by
git-fast-import.  This means that it can be used on any
version-control system that that has both fast-export and fast-import
utilities.  This set includes git itself, hg, bzr, and Subversion. As
version-control systems add support for the fast-import format, their
reppositories will automatically become editable by repoosurgeon see 
the https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/InterfacesFrontendsAndTools[Git 
Wiki tools page] for a large collection of such tools.

It is a design constraint that all reposurgeon operations either
preserve all repository state they are not explicitly told to modify
or warn you when they cannot do so.  Users should, however, be aware
of limitations in the ability of the fast-import format to capture 
repository state. Presently the most significant such limitation is
that the dumps do not capture git lightweight tags.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

= Reposurgeon Theory of Operation =
Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>

The purpose of reposurgeon is to enable risky operations that
version-control systems don't want to let you do, such as (a) editing
past comments and metadata, (b) excising commits, (c) coalescing
commits, and (d) removing files and subtrees from repo history. The
original motivation for reposurgeon was to clean up artifacts
created by repository conversions.

To keep reposurgeon simple and flexible, it does not do its own
repository reading and writing.  Instead, it relies on being able to
parse and emit the dump format created by git-fast-export and read by
git-fast-import.  This means that it can be used on any
version-control system that that has both fast-export and fast-import
utilities.  This set includes git itself, hg, and bzr. 

Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't directly supported because exporting from
them requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

As version-control systems add support for the fast-import format,
their reppositories will automatically become editable by repoosurgeon
see the
https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/InterfacesFrontendsAndTools[Git
Wiki tools page] for a large collection of such tools.

It is a design constraint that all reposurgeon operations either
preserve all repository state they are not explicitly told to modify
or warn you when they cannot do so.  Users should, however, be aware
of limitations in the ability of the fast-import format to capture 
repository state. Presently the most significant such known 
limitations are:

* Under git, dumps do not capture git lightweight tags.

* Under bzr, dumps do not capture information about (a) multiple-author 
commits, (b) bzr custom commit properties (e.g. branch-nick and bugs 
fixed by this change), or (c) empty directories.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

			rs - a repository surgeon

eposurgeon enables risky operations that version-control systems don't
want to let you do, such as (a) editing past comments and metadata,
(b) excising commits, (c) coalescing commits, and (d) removing files
and subtrees from repo history. The original motivation for
reposurgeon was to clean up artifacts created by repository
conversions.

To test the correctness of this software, change to the 'test' subdirectory
and type 'make'.

import sys, os, getopt, commands, cStringIO, cmd, tempfile

#
# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>

The purpose of reposurgeon is to enable risky operations that version-control
systems don't want to let you do, such as (a) editing past comments and 
metadata, (b) excising commits, and (c) coalescing commits. The motivation
for reposurgeon was to help with artifacts and sca r tisue created by 
repository conversions.

The reposurgeon tool depends on being able to map all the version-control
systems it knows about into a common data model.  Here are the components 
of the model:

1. A sequence of commit objects.  The primary key for these objects is
the date of the commit. Each commit represents an ebtire state of
some file tree.

2. A map of the is-a-parent-of relationship. A commit may have multiplre 
parents; the map implies a DAG (directed acyclic graph) of commits.

3. A list of branch heads.  This is a mapping from names to tip 
revisions in the DAG.

4. A list of tags (name-to-commit mappings).

This model is intended to capture the common semantics of distributed
version-control systems: the three specific tarhets are git, hg, and
Subversion (more may be added in future).

It is a design constraint that all reposurgeon operations either prserve
all VCS-specific metadata thety are not told to modify or warn you when
they cannot.

= Reposurgeon Theory of Operation =
Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>

The purpose of reposurgeon is to enable risky operations that
version-control systems don't want to let you do, such as (a) editing
past comments and metadata, (b) excising commits, (c) coalescing
commits, and (d) removing files and subtrees from repo history. The
original motivation for reposurgeon was to clean up artifacts
created by repository conversions.

To keep reposurgeon simple and flexible, it does not do its own
repository reading and writing.  Instead, it relies on being able to
parse and emit the dump format created by git-fast-export and read by
git-fast-import.  This means that it can be used on any
version-control system that that has both fast-export and fast-import
utilities.  This set includes git itself, hg, bzr, and Subversion. As
version-control systems add support for the fast-import format, their
reppositories will automatically become editable by repoosurgeon see 
the https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/InterfacesFrontendsAndTools[Git 
Wiki tools page] for a large collection of such tools.

It is a design constraint that all reposurgeon operations either
preserve all repository state they are not explicitly told to modify
or warn you when they cannot do so.  Users should, however, be aware
of limitations in the ability of the fast-import format to capture 
repository state. Presently the most significant such limitation is
that the dumps do not capture git lightweight tags.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the

#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.

# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

#
# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

= Reposurgeon Theory of Operation =
Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>

The purpose of reposurgeon is to enable risky operations that
version-control systems don't want to let you do, such as (a) editing
past comments and metadata, (b) excising commits, (c) coalescing
commits, and (d) removing files and subtrees from repo history. The
original motivation for reposurgeon was to clean up artifacts
created by repository conversions.

To keep reposurgeon simple and flexible, it does not do its own
repository reading and writing.  Instead, it relies on being able to
parse and emit the dump format created by git-fast-export and read by
git-fast-import.  This means that it can be used on any
version-control system that that has both fast-export and fast-import
utilities.  This set includes git itself, hg, and bzr. 

Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't directly supported because exporting from
them requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

As version-control systems add support for the fast-import format,
their reppositories will automatically become editable by repoosurgeon
see the
https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/InterfacesFrontendsAndTools[Git
Wiki tools page] for a large collection of such tools.

It is a design constraint that all reposurgeon operations either
preserve all repository state they are not explicitly told to modify
or warn you when they cannot do so.  Users should, however, be aware
of limitations in the ability of the fast-import format to capture 
repository state. Presently the most significant such known 
limitations are:

* Under git, dumps do not capture git lightweight tags.

* Under bzr, dumps do not capture information about (a) multiple-author 
commits, (b) bzr custom commit properties (e.g. branch-nick and bugs 
fixed by this change), or (c) empty directories.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

= Reposurgeon Theory of Operation =
Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>

The purpose of reposurgeon is to enable risky operations that
version-control systems don't want to let you do, such as (a) editing
past comments and metadata, (b) excising commits, (c) coalescing
commits, and (d) removing files and subtrees from repo history. The
original motivation for reposurgeon was to clean up artifacts
created by repository conversions.

To keep reposurgeon simple and flexible, it does not do its own
repository reading and writing.  Instead, it relies on being able to
parse and emit the dump format created by git-fast-export and read by
git-fast-import.  This means that it can be used on any
version-control system that that has both fast-export and fast-import
utilities.  This set includes git itself, hg, and bzr. 

Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't directly supported because exporting from
them requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

As version-control systems add support for the fast-import format,
their repositories will automatically become editable by reposurgeon
see the
https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/InterfacesFrontendsAndTools[Git
Wiki tools page] for a large collection of such tools.

It is a design constraint that all reposurgeon operations either
preserve all repository state they are not explicitly told to modify
or warn you when they cannot do so.  Users should, however, be aware
of limitations in the ability of the fast-import format to capture 
repository state. Presently the most significant such known 
limitations are:

* Under bzr, dumps do not capture information about (a) multiple-author 
commits, (b) bzr custom commit properties (e.g. branch-nick and bugs 
fixed by this change), or (c) empty directories.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

<refsect1 id='description'><title>DESCRIPTION</title>

<para>The purpose of <application>reposurgeon</application> is to
enable risky operations that version-control systems don't want to let
you do, such as (a) editing past comments and metadata, (b) excising
commits, (c) coalescing commits, and (d) removing files and subtrees
from repo history. The original motivation for
<application>reposurgeon</application> was to clean up artifacts
created by repository conversions.</para>

<para>To keep <application>reposurgeon</application> simple and
flexible, it does not do its own repository reading and writing.
Instead, it relies on being able to parse and emit the repo-command
streams created by git-fast-export and read by git-fast-import.  This
means that it can be used on any version-control system that that has
both fast-export and fast-import utilities.  This set includes git
itself, hg, and bzr.</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1 id='options'><title>OPERATION</title>
<para>The program can be run in one of two modes, either as an interactive
command interpreter or to execute commands given as arguments on the
<application>reposurgeon</application> command line. The only difference
between these modes is that the interactive one begins by turning on the
'verbose' option.</para>

<para>Here are the available commands:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term>help</term>
<listitem><para>Get help on the interpreter commands. Optionally follow with
whitespace and a command name; with no argument, lists all commands. '?'
also invokes this.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>version</term>
<listitem><para>Report the version of <application>reposurgeon</application>
and the list of version-control systems it directly supports.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>verbose</term>
<listitem><para>'verbose 1' enables progress and statistics messages,
'verbose 0' disables them. 
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>shell</term>
<listitem><para>Execute the shell command given in the remainder of the line.
'!' also invokes this.  
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>read</term>
<listitem><para>With a directory-name argument, this command attempts
to read in the contents of a repository in any supported
version-control system under that directory; read with no
arguments does this in the current directory. If the argument is the
name of a plain file, it will be read in as a fast-import stream. With
an argument of <quote>-</quote>, this command reads a fast-import
stream from standard input (this will be useful in filters constructed
with command-line arguments).</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
</refsect1>

<refsect1 id='limitations'><title>LIMITATIONS AND GUARANTEES</title>

<para>Guarantee: <application>reposurgeon</application> never modifies
the contents of a repository it reads or deletes any repository. The
results of surgery are always expressed in a new repository </para>

<para>Guarantee: Any line in a fast-import stream that is not a part
of a command <application>reposurgeon</application> parses and
understands will be passed through unaltered.  At present the set of
potential passthroughs is known to include the
<command>progress</command>, the <command>options</command>, and
<command>checkpoint</command> commands as well as comments led by
#.</para>

<para>Guarantee: All <application>reposurgeon</application> operations either
preserve all repository state they are not explicitly told to modify
or warn you when they cannot do so.</para>

<para>Limitation: Because <application>reposurgeon</application>
relies on other programs to generate and imterpret the fast-import command
stream, it is subject to bugs in those prograns.</para>

<para>Limitation: Under version-control systems other than git,
fast-import format may not capture the entire repository
state. Presently the only known limitations are:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>

transform repo-command streams and cope with the export/import

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

<refsect1 id='description'><title>DESCRIPTION</title>

<para>The purpose of <application>reposurgeon</application> is to
enable risky operations that version-control systems don't want to let
you do, such as (a) editing past comments and metadata, (b) excising
commits, (c) coalescing commits, and (d) removing files and subtrees
from repo history. The original motivation for
<application>reposurgeon</application> was to clean up artifacts
created by repository conversions.</para>

<para>To keep <application>reposurgeon</application> simple and
flexible, it does not do its own repository reading and writing.
Instead, it relies on being able to parse and emit the repo-command
streams created by git-fast-export and read by git-fast-import.  This
means that it can be used on any version-control system that that has
both fast-export and fast-import utilities.  This set includes git
itself, hg, and bzr.</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1 id='options'><title>OPERATION</title>
<para>The program can be run in one of two modes, either as an interactive
command interpreter or to execute commands given as arguments on the
<application>reposurgeon</application> command line. The only difference
between these modes is that the interactive one begins by turning on the
'verbose' option.</para>

<para>Here are the available commands:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term>help</term>
<listitem><para>Get help on the interpreter commands. Optionally follow with
whitespace and a command name; with no argument, lists all commands. '?'
also invokes this.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>version</term>
<listitem><para>Report the version of <application>reposurgeon</application>
and the list of version-control systems it directly supports.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>verbose</term>
<listitem><para>'verbose 1' enables progress and statistics messages,
'verbose 0' disables them. 
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>shell</term>
<listitem><para>Execute the shell command given in the remainder of the line.
'!' also invokes this.  
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>read</term>
<listitem><para>With a directory-name argument, this command attempts
to read in the contents of a repository in any supported
version-control system under that directory; read with no
arguments does this in the current directory. If the argument is the
name of a plain file, it will be read in as a fast-import stream. With
an argument of <quote>-</quote>, this command reads a fast-import
stream from standard input (this will be useful in filters constructed
with command-line arguments).</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>
</refsect1>

<refsect1 id='limitations'><title>LIMITATIONS AND GUARANTEES</title>

<para>Guarantee: <application>reposurgeon</application> never modifies
the contents of a repository it reads or deletes any repository. The
results of surgery are always expressed in a new repository </para>

<para>Guarantee: Any line in a fast-import stream that is not a part
of a command <application>reposurgeon</application> parses and
understands will be passed through unaltered.  At present the set of
potential passthroughs is known to include the
<command>progress</command>, the <command>options</command>, and
<command>checkpoint</command> commands as well as comments led by
#.</para>

<para>Guarantee: All <application>reposurgeon</application> operations either
preserve all repository state they are not explicitly told to modify
or warn you when they cannot do so.</para>

<para>Limitation: Because <application>reposurgeon</application>
relies on other programs to generate and imterpret the fast-import command
stream, it is subject to bugs in those prograns.</para>

<para>Limitation: Under version-control systems other than git,
fast-import format may not capture the entire repository
state. Presently the only known limitations are:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Under bzr, dumps do not capture information about (a) multiple-author 
commits, (b) bzr custom commit properties (e.g. branch-nick and bugs 
fixed by this change), or (c) empty directories.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Limitation: Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't directly supported because exporting
from them requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to
full email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
transform repo-command streams and cope with the export/import
separately.</para>

<para>Guarantee: As version-control systems add support for the
fast-import format, their repositories will become editable by
<application>reposurgeon</application>. See the <ulink
url="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/InterfacesFrontendsAndTools">Git
Wiki tools page</ulink> for a large collection of such tools.</para>

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the

# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.

<refsect1 id='description'><title>DESCRIPTION</title>

<para>The purpose of <application>reposurgeon</application> is to
enable risky operations that version-control systems don't want to let
you do, such as (a) editing past comments and metadata, (b) excising
commits, (c) coalescing commits, and (d) removing files and subtrees
from repo history. The original motivation for
<application>reposurgeon</application> was to clean up artifacts
created by repository conversions.</para>

<para>To keep <application>reposurgeon</application> simple and
flexible, it does not do its own repository reading and writing.
Instead, it relies on being able to parse and emit the repo-command
streams created by git-fast-export and read by git-fast-import.  This
means that it can be used on any version-control system that that has
both fast-export and fast-import utilities.  This set includes git
itself, hg, and bzr.</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1 id='options'><title>OPERATION</title>
<para>The program can be run in one of two modes, either as an interactive
command interpreter or to execute commands given as arguments on the
<application>reposurgeon</application> command line. The only difference
between these modes is that the interactive one begins by turning on the
'verbose' option.</para>

<para>Here are the available commands:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>help</term>
<listitem><para>Get help on the interpreter commands. Optionally follow with
whitespace and a command name; with no argument, lists all commands. '?'
also invokes this.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>version</term>
<listitem><para>Report the version of <application>reposurgeon</application>
and the list of version-control systems it directly supports.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>verbose</term>
<listitem><para>'verbose 1' enables progress and statistics messages,
'verbose 0' disables them. 
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>shell</term>
<listitem><para>Execute the shell command given in the remainder of the line.
'!' also invokes this.  
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>prefer</term>
<listitem>
<para>Report or set (with argument) the preferred type of repository. This
will have two effects.  First, if there are multiple repositories in a
directory you do a read on, reposurgeon will read the preferred one
(otherwise it will complain that it can't choose among them).
Secondly, if you do a write to a directory, it will build a repo of
the preferred type.</para>

<para>If no preferred type has been explicitly selected, reading in a
repository (but not a fast-import stream) will implicitly set it
to the type of that repository.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>read</term>
<listitem><para>With a directory-name argument, this command attempts
to read in the contents of a repository in any supported
version-control system under that directory; read with no
arguments does this in the current directory. If the argument is the
name of a plain file, it will be read in as a fast-import stream. With
an argument of <quote>-</quote>, this command reads a fast-import
stream from standard input (this will be useful in filters constructed
with command-line arguments).</para></listitem>

<refsect1 id='limitations'><title>LIMITATIONS AND GUARANTEES</title>

<para>Guarantee: <application>reposurgeon</application> never modifies
the contents of a repository it reads or deletes any repository. The
results of surgery are always expressed in a new repository </para>

<para>Guarantee: Any line in a fast-import stream that is not a part
of a command <application>reposurgeon</application> parses and
understands will be passed through unaltered.  At present the set of
potential passthroughs is known to include the
<command>progress</command>, the <command>options</command>, and
<command>checkpoint</command> commands as well as comments led by
#.</para>

<para>Guarantee: All <application>reposurgeon</application> operations either
preserve all repository state they are not explicitly told to modify
or warn you when they cannot do so.</para>

<para>Limitation: Because <application>reposurgeon</application>
relies on other programs to generate and imterpret the fast-import command
stream, it is subject to bugs in those prograns.</para>

<para>Limitation: Under version-control systems other than git,
fast-import format may not capture the entire repository
state. Presently the only known limitations are:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Under bzr, dumps do not capture information about (a) multiple-author 
commits, (b) bzr custom commit properties (e.g. branch-nick and bugs 
fixed by this change), or (c) empty directories.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Limitation: Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't directly supported because exporting
from them requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to
full email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
transform repo-command streams and cope with the export/import
separately.</para>

<para>Guarantee: As version-control systems add support for the
fast-import format, their repositories will become editable by
<application>reposurgeon</application>. See the <ulink
url="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/InterfacesFrontendsAndTools">Git
Wiki tools page</ulink> for a large collection of such tools.</para>

#
# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

<refsect1 id='description'><title>DESCRIPTION</title>

<para>The purpose of <application>reposurgeon</application> is to
enable risky operations that version-control systems don't want to let
you do, such as (a) editing past comments and metadata, (b) excising
commits, (c) coalescing commits, and (d) removing files and subtrees
from repo history. The original motivation for
<application>reposurgeon</application> was to clean up artifacts
created by repository conversions.</para>

<para>To keep <application>reposurgeon</application> simple and
flexible, it does not do its own repository reading and writing.
Instead, it relies on being able to parse and emit the repo-command
streams created by git-fast-export and read by git-fast-import.  This
means that it can be used on any version-control system that that has
both fast-export and fast-import utilities.  This set includes git
itself, hg, and bzr.</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1 id='options'><title>OPERATION</title>
<para>The program can be run in one of two modes, either as an interactive
command interpreter or to execute commands given as arguments on the
<application>reposurgeon</application> command line. The only difference
between these modes is that the interactive one begins by turning on the
'verbose' option.</para>

<para>Here are the available commands:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>help</term>
<listitem><para>Get help on the interpreter commands. Optionally follow with
whitespace and a command name; with no argument, lists all commands. '?'
also invokes this.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>version</term>
<listitem><para>Report the version of <application>reposurgeon</application>
and the list of version-control systems it directly supports.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>verbose</term>
<listitem><para>'verbose 1' enables progress and statistics messages,
'verbose 0' disables them. 
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>shell</term>
<listitem><para>Execute the shell command given in the remainder of the line.
'!' also invokes this.  
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>prefer</term>
<listitem>
<para>Report or set (with argument) the preferred type of repository. This
will have two effects.  First, if there are multiple repositories in a
directory you do a read on, reposurgeon will read the preferred one
(otherwise it will complain that it can't choose among them).
Secondly, if you do a write to a directory, it will build a repo of
the preferred type.</para>

<para>If no preferred type has been explicitly selected, reading in a
repository (but not a fast-import stream) will implicitly set it
to the type of that repository.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>read</term>
<listitem><para>With a directory-name argument, this command attempts
to read in the contents of a repository in any supported
version-control system under that directory; read with no
arguments does this in the current directory. If the argument is the
name of a plain file, it will be read in as a fast-import stream. With
an argument of <quote>-</quote>, this command reads a fast-import
stream from standard input (this will be useful in filters constructed
with command-line arguments).</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<term>write</term>
<listitem><para>

and is a directory or anything other than a plain file.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>rebuild</term>
<listitem><para>
Rebuild a repository from the state held by
<application>reposurgeon</application>.  The argument specifies the
target directory in which to do the rebuild; if the repository read
was from a repo directory (and not a git-import stream), it defaults
to that directory.  If the target directory is nonempty its contents
are backed up to a save directory.

</refsect1>

<refsect1 id='limitations'><title>LIMITATIONS AND GUARANTEES</title>

<para>Guarantee: <application>reposurgeon</application> never modifies
the contents of a repository it reads or deletes any repository. The
results of surgery are always expressed in a new repository </para>

<para>Guarantee: Any line in a fast-import stream that is not a part
of a command <application>reposurgeon</application> parses and
understands will be passed through unaltered.  At present the set of
potential passthroughs is known to include the
<command>progress</command>, the <command>options</command>, and
<command>checkpoint</command> commands as well as comments led by
#.</para>

<para>Guarantee: All <application>reposurgeon</application> operations either
preserve all repository state they are not explicitly told to modify
or warn you when they cannot do so.</para>

<para>Limitation: Because <application>reposurgeon</application>
relies on other programs to generate and imterpret the fast-import command
stream, it is subject to bugs in those prograns.</para>

<para>Limitation: Under version-control systems other than git,
fast-import format may not capture the entire repository
state. Presently the only known limitations are:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Under bzr, dumps do not capture information about (a) multiple-author 
commits, (b) bzr custom commit properties (e.g. branch-nick and bugs 
fixed by this change), or (c) empty directories.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Limitation: Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't directly supported because exporting
from them requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to
full email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
transform repo-command streams and cope with the export/import
separately.</para>

<para>Guarantee: As version-control systems add support for the
fast-import format, their repositories will become editable by
<application>reposurgeon</application>. See the <ulink
url="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/InterfacesFrontendsAndTools">Git
Wiki tools page</ulink> for a large collection of such tools.</para>

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

<refsect1 id='description'><title>DESCRIPTION</title>

<para>The purpose of <application>reposurgeon</application> is to
enable risky operations that version-control systems don't want to let
you do, such as (a) editing past comments and metadata, (b) excising
commits, (c) coalescing commits, and (d) removing files and subtrees
from repo history. The original motivation for
<application>reposurgeon</application> was to clean up artifacts
created by repository conversions.</para>

<para>To keep <application>reposurgeon</application> simple and
flexible, it does not do its own repository reading and writing.
Instead, it relies on being able to parse and emit the repo-command
streams created by git-fast-export and read by git-fast-import.  This
means that it can be used on any version-control system that that has
both fast-export and fast-import utilities.  This set includes git
itself, hg, and bzr.</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1 id='options'><title>OPERATION</title>
<para>The program can be run in one of two modes, either as an interactive
command interpreter or to execute commands given as arguments on the
<application>reposurgeon</application> command line. The only difference
between these modes is that the interactive one begins by turning on the
'verbose 1' option.</para>

<para>Here are the available commands:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>help</term>
<listitem><para>Get help on the interpreter commands. Optionally follow with
whitespace and a command name; with no argument, lists all commands. '?'
also invokes this.
</para></listitem>

<refsect1 id='limitations'><title>LIMITATIONS AND GUARANTEES</title>

<para>Guarantee: <application>reposurgeon</application> never modifies
the contents of a repository it reads or deletes any repository. The
results of surgery are always expressed in a new repository </para>

<para>Guarantee: Any line in a fast-import stream that is not a part
of a command <application>reposurgeon</application> parses and
understands will be passed through unaltered.  At present the set of
potential passthroughs is known to include the
<command>progress</command>, the <command>options</command>, and
<command>checkpoint</command> commands as well as comments led by
#.</para>

<para>Guarantee: All <application>reposurgeon</application> operations either
preserve all repository state they are not explicitly told to modify
or warn you when they cannot do so.</para>

<para>Limitation: Because <application>reposurgeon</application>
relies on other programs to generate and imterpret the fast-import command
stream, it is subject to bugs in those prograns.</para>

<para>Limitation: Under version-control systems other than git,
fast-import format may not capture the entire repository
state. Presently the only known limitations are:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Under bzr, dumps do not capture information about (a) multiple-author 
commits, (b) bzr custom commit properties (e.g. branch-nick and bugs 
fixed by this change), or (c) empty directories.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Limitation: Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't directly supported because exporting
from them requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to
full email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
transform repo-command streams and cope with the export/import
separately.</para>

<para>Guarantee: As version-control systems add support for the
fast-import format, their repositories will become editable by
<application>reposurgeon</application>. See the <ulink
url="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/InterfacesFrontendsAndTools">Git
Wiki tools page</ulink> for a large collection of such tools.</para>

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

<refsect1 id='description'><title>DESCRIPTION</title>

<para>The purpose of <application>reposurgeon</application> is to
enable risky operations that version-control systems don't want to let
you do, such as (a) editing past comments and metadata, (b) excising
commits, (c) coalescing commits, and (d) removing files and subtrees
from repo history. The original motivation for
<application>reposurgeon</application> was to clean up artifacts
created by repository conversions.</para>

<para>To keep <application>reposurgeon</application> simple and
flexible, it does not do its own repository reading and writing.
Instead, it relies on being able to parse and emit the repo-command
streams created by git-fast-export and read by git-fast-import.  This
means that it can be used on any version-control system that that has
both fast-export and fast-import utilities.  This set includes git
itself, hg, and bzr.</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1 id='options'><title>OPERATION</title>
<para>The program can be run in one of two modes, either as an interactive
command interpreter or to execute commands given as arguments on the
<application>reposurgeon</application> command line. The only difference
between these modes is that the interactive one begins by turning on the
'verbose 1' option.</para>

<para>Here are the available commands:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>help</term>
<listitem><para>Get help on the interpreter commands. Optionally follow with
whitespace and a command name; with no argument, lists all commands. '?'
also invokes this.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>version</term>
<listitem><para>Report the version of <application>reposurgeon</application>
and the list of version-control systems it directly supports.

</varlistentry>

<term>verbose</term>
<listitem><para>'verbose 1' enables progress and messages,
'verbose 0' disables them. Higher levels of verbosity are available
but intended for developers only.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>shell</term>
<listitem><para>Execute the shell command given in the remainder of the line.

<refsect1 id='limitations'><title>LIMITATIONS AND GUARANTEES</title>

<para>Guarantee: <application>reposurgeon</application> never modifies
the contents of a repository it reads or deletes any repository. The
results of surgery are always expressed in a new repository </para>

<para>Guarantee: Any line in a fast-import stream that is not a part
of a command <application>reposurgeon</application> parses and
understands will be passed through unaltered.  At present the set of
potential passthroughs is known to include the
<command>progress</command>, the <command>options</command>, and
<command>checkpoint</command> commands as well as comments led by
#.</para>

<para>Guarantee: All <application>reposurgeon</application> operations either
preserve all repository state they are not explicitly told to modify
or warn you when they cannot do so.</para>

<para>Limitation: Because <application>reposurgeon</application>
relies on other programs to generate and imterpret the fast-import command
stream, it is subject to bugs in those prograns.</para>

<para>Limitation: Under version-control systems other than git,
fast-import format may not capture the entire repository
state. Presently the only known limitations are:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Under bzr, dumps do not capture information about (a) multiple-author 
commits, (b) bzr custom commit properties (e.g. branch-nick and bugs 
fixed by this change), or (c) empty directories.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Limitation: Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't directly supported because exporting
from them requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to
full email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
transform repo-command streams and cope with the export/import
separately.</para>

<para>Guarantee: As version-control systems add support for the
fast-import format, their repositories will become editable by
<application>reposurgeon</application>. See the <ulink
url="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/InterfacesFrontendsAndTools">Git
Wiki tools page</ulink> for a large collection of such tools.</para>

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.

# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them

<refsect1 id='description'><title>DESCRIPTION</title>

<para>The purpose of <application>reposurgeon</application> is to
enable risky operations that version-control systems don't want to let
you do, such as (a) editing past comments and metadata, (b) excising
commits, (c) coalescing commits, and (d) removing files and subtrees
from repo history. The original motivation for
<application>reposurgeon</application> was to clean up artifacts
created by repository conversions.</para>

<para>To keep <application>reposurgeon</application> simple and
flexible, it does not do its own repository reading and writing.
Instead, it relies on being able to parse and emit the repo-command
streams created by git-fast-export and read by git-fast-import.  This
means that it can be used on any version-control system that that has
both fast-export and fast-import utilities.  This set includes git
itself, hg, and bzr.</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1 id='options'><title>OPERATION</title>
<para>The program can be run in one of two modes, either as an interactive
command interpreter or to execute commands given as arguments on the
<application>reposurgeon</application> command line. The only difference
between these modes is that the interactive one begins by turning on the
'verbose 1' option.</para>

<para>Here are the available and planned surgical commands:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><cmdsynopsis><command>delete</command></cmdsynopsis></term>
<listitem>
<para>Delete a span of commits.  Requires a commit-range argument.</para>
<!-- document handling of tags, branches, renames, deletes, copies. --> 
<para>NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><cmdsynopsis><command>expunge</command></cmdsynopsis></term>
<listitem>
<para>Expunge a file from the repo history.</para>
<!-- document handling of tags, branches, renames, deletes, copies. --> 
<para>NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><cmdsynopsis><command>coalesce</command></cmdsynopsis></term>
<listitem>
<para>Scan the history for runs of commits with identical comments close to
each other in time (this is a common form of scar tissues in
repository up-conversions from older file-oriented version-control systems).
Merge these cliques.</para>

<para>The required first argument is a commit range to operate on.  The optional
second argument, if present, is a maximum time separation in seconds;
the default is 90 seconds.</para>
<!-- document handling of tags, branches, renames, deletes, copies. --> 
<para>NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><cmdsynopsis><command>edit</command></cmdsynopsis></term>
<listitem>
<para>Edit a blob or commit or tag, identified by date or mark or tag
name.</para>
<para>NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>A commit range is either a single commit identifier or a pair
of them separated by "..".  A commit identifier is a mark number
(preceded by ':'). There are some commands that help you find interesting
mark numbers:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><cmdsynopsis><command>index</command> <arg choice="opt">+b</arg></cmdsynopsis></term>
<listitem>
<para>Display four columns of info on objects: their number, their type,
the associate mark (or '-' if no mark) and a summary field varying by type.
For a branch or tag it's the reference; for a commit it's the commit branch;
for a blob it's the repository path of the fiile in the blob.</para>

<para>Normally, listing of blobs in the index is suppressed, as it is not very
useful to list them independently of the commits that reference them. The
<option>+b</option> option enables display of blobs.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>These are backed up by the following housekeeping commands:</para>

<variablelist>

<listitem><para>Get help on the interpreter commands. Optionally follow with
whitespace and a command name; with no argument, lists all commands. '?'

</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><cmdsynopsis><command>prefer</command></cmdsynopsis></term>
<listitem>
<para>Report or set (with argument) the preferred type of repository. This

<refsect1 id='limitations'><title>LIMITATIONS AND GUARANTEES</title>

<para>Guarantee: <application>reposurgeon</application> never modifies
the contents of a repository it reads or deletes any repository. The
results of surgery are always expressed in a new repository </para>

<para>Guarantee: Any line in a fast-import stream that is not a part
of a command <application>reposurgeon</application> parses and
understands will be passed through unaltered.  At present the set of
potential passthroughs is known to include the
<command>progress</command>, the <command>options</command>, and
<command>checkpoint</command> commands as well as comments led by
#.</para>

<para>Guarantee: All <application>reposurgeon</application> operations either
preserve all repository state they are not explicitly told to modify
or warn you when they cannot do so.</para>

<para>Limitation: Because <application>reposurgeon</application>
relies on other programs to generate and imterpret the fast-import command
stream, it is subject to bugs in those prograns.</para>

<para>Limitation: Under version-control systems other than git,
fast-import format may not capture the entire repository
state. Presently the only known limitations are:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Under bzr, dumps do not capture information about (a) multiple-author 
commits, (b) bzr custom commit properties (e.g. branch-nick and bugs 
fixed by this change), or (c) empty directories.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Limitation: Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't directly supported because exporting
from them requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to
full email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
transform repo-command streams and cope with the export/import
separately.</para>

<para>Guarantee: As version-control systems add support for the
fast-import format, their repositories will become editable by
<application>reposurgeon</application>. See the <ulink
url="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/InterfacesFrontendsAndTools">Git
Wiki tools page</ulink> for a large collection of such tools.</para>

# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the

# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,

#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

#
# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

<refsect1 id='description'><title>DESCRIPTION</title>

<para>The purpose of <application>reposurgeon</application> is to
enable risky operations that version-control systems don't want to let
you do, such as (a) editing past comments and metadata, (b) excising
commits, (c) coalescing commits, and (d) removing files and subtrees
from repo history. The original motivation for
<application>reposurgeon</application> was to clean up artifacts
created by repository conversions.</para>

<para>To keep <application>reposurgeon</application> simple and
flexible, it does not do its own repository reading and writing.
Instead, it relies on being able to parse and emit the repo-command
streams created by git-fast-export and read by git-fast-import.  This
means that it can be used on any version-control system that that has
both fast-export and fast-import utilities.  This set includes git
itself, hg, and bzr.</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1 id='options'><title>OPERATION</title>
<para>The program can be run in one of two modes, either as an interactive
command interpreter or to execute commands given as arguments on the
<application>reposurgeon</application> invocation line. The only difference
between these modes is that the interactive one begins by turning on the
'verbose 1' option.</para>

<para>A git-fast-import stream consists of a sequence of commands
which must be executed in the specified sequence to build the repo;
to avoiid confusion with <application>reposurgeon</application> commands
we will refer to the stream commands here as <emphasis>events</emphasis>.
These events are implicitly numbered from 1 upwards.  Most commands
require specifying a selection of event sequence numbers so
<application>reposurgeon</application> will know which events to
modify or delete.</para>

<para>When a command takes a selection-set argument, it will
<emphasis>precede</emphasis> the command keyword; other arguments will
follow. It is often possible to omit the selection-set argument and
have it default to something reasonable, usuaally the entire event 
sequence.</para>

<para>Here are some motivating examples.  The commands will be
explained in more detail after the description of selection
syntax.</para>

<programlisting>
:15 edit                     ;; edit the object associated with mark :15

29..71 index                 ;; list summary index of events 20..71

=t &amp; 1..:97 delete            ;; delete tags from event 1 to mark 15
</programlisting>

<para>The selection-set specification syntax is an expression-oriented 
minilanguage.  The most basic term in this language is a 
<firstterm>location</firstterm>. The following sorts of primitive locations
are supported:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><firstterm>event numbers</firstterm></term>
<listitem><para>A plain numeric literal is interpreted as a 1-origin
event-sequence number.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><firstterm>marks</firstterm></term>
<listitem><para>A numeric literal preceded by a colon is interpreted
as a mark; see the format documentation for explanation of the 
semantics of marks.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>These may be grouped into sets in the following ways:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><firstterm>ranges</firstterm></term>
<listitem><para>A range is two locations separated by "..", and is

<refsect1 id='limitations'><title>LIMITATIONS AND GUARANTEES</title>

<para>Guarantee: <application>reposurgeon</application> never modifies
the contents of a repository it reads or deletes any repository. The
results of surgery are always expressed in a new repository </para>

<para>Guarantee: Any line in a fast-import stream that is not a part
of a command <application>reposurgeon</application> parses and
understands will be passed through unaltered.  At present the set of
potential passthroughs is known to include the
<command>progress</command>, the <command>options</command>, and
<command>checkpoint</command> commands as well as comments led by
#.</para>

<para>Guarantee: All <application>reposurgeon</application> operations either
preserve all repository state they are not explicitly told to modify
or warn you when they cannot do so.</para>

<para>Limitation: Because <application>reposurgeon</application>
relies on other programs to generate and imterpret the fast-import command
stream, it is subject to bugs in those prograns.</para>

<para>Limitation: Under version-control systems other than git,
fast-import format may not capture the entire repository
state. Presently the only known limitations are:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Under bzr, dumps do not capture information about (a) multiple-author 
commits, (b) bzr custom commit properties (e.g. branch-nick and bugs 
fixed by this change), or (c) empty directories.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Limitation: Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't directly supported because exporting
from them requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to
full email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
transform repo-command streams and cope with the export/import
separately.</para>

<para>Guarantee: As version-control systems add support for the
fast-import format, their repositories will become editable by
<application>reposurgeon</application>. See the <ulink
url="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/InterfacesFrontendsAndTools">Git
Wiki tools page</ulink> for a large collection of such tools.</para>

Rebuild a repository from the state held by
<application>reposurgeon</application>.  The argument specifies the
target directory in which to do the rebuild; if the repository read
was from a repo directory (and not a git-import stream), it defaults
to that directory.  If the target directory is nonempty its contents
are backed up to a save directory.

View a repo through the default GUI browser for its version control
system.  Note that this does not show the edited state held by
<application>reposurgeon</application> in core; it is mainly useful
for doing a quick eyeball check ofter a rebuild command.

<refsect1 id='limitations'><title>LIMITATIONS AND GUARANTEES</title>

<para>Guarantee: <application>reposurgeon</application> never modifies
the contents of a repository it reads or deletes any repository. The
results of surgery are always expressed in a new repository </para>

<para>Guarantee: Any line in a fast-import stream that is not a part
of a command <application>reposurgeon</application> parses and
understands will be passed through unaltered.  At present the set of
potential passthroughs is known to include the
<command>progress</command>, the <command>options</command>, and
<command>checkpoint</command> commands as well as comments led by
#.</para>

<para>Guarantee: All <application>reposurgeon</application> operations either
preserve all repository state they are not explicitly told to modify
or warn you when they cannot do so.</para>

<para>Limitation: Because <application>reposurgeon</application>
relies on other programs to generate and imterpret the fast-import command
stream, it is subject to bugs in those prograns.</para>

<para>Limitation: Under version-control systems other than git,
fast-import format may not capture the entire repository
state. Presently the only known limitations are:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Under bzr, dumps do not capture information about (a) multiple-author 
commits, (b) bzr custom commit properties (e.g. branch-nick and bugs 
fixed by this change), or (c) empty directories.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Limitation: Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't directly supported because exporting
from them requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to
full email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
transform repo-command streams and cope with the export/import
separately.</para>

<para>Guarantee: As version-control systems add support for the
fast-import format, their repositories will become editable by
<application>reposurgeon</application>. See the <ulink
url="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/InterfacesFrontendsAndTools">Git
Wiki tools page</ulink> for a large collection of such tools.</para>

#
# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

#
# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.

<refsect1 id='description'><title>DESCRIPTION</title>

<para>The purpose of <application>reposurgeon</application> is to
enable risky operations that version-control systems don't want to let
you do, such as (a) editing past comments and metadata, (b) excising
commits, (c) coalescing commits, and (d) removing files and subtrees
from repo history. The original motivation for
<application>reposurgeon</application> was to clean up artifacts
created by repository conversions.</para>

<para>To keep <application>reposurgeon</application> simple and
flexible, it does not do its own repository reading and writing.
Instead, it relies on being able to parse and emit the repo-command
streams created by git-fast-export and read by git-fast-import.  This
means that it can be used on any version-control system that that has
both fast-export and fast-import utilities.  This set includes git
itself, hg, and bzr.</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1 id='options'><title>OPERATION</title>
<para>The program can be run in one of two modes, either as an interactive
command interpreter or to execute commands given as arguments on the
<application>reposurgeon</application> invocation line. The only difference
between these modes is that the interactive one begins by turning on the
'verbose 1' option.</para>

<para>A git-fast-import stream consists of a sequence of commands
which must be executed in the specified sequence to build the repo;
to avoiid confusion with <application>reposurgeon</application> commands
we will refer to the stream commands here as <emphasis>events</emphasis>.
These events are implicitly numbered from 1 upwards.  Most commands
require specifying a selection of event sequence numbers so
<application>reposurgeon</application> will know which events to
modify or delete.</para>

<para>When a command takes a selection-set argument, it will
immediately follow the command keyword; other arguments will
follow. It is often possible to omit the selection-set argument and
have it default to something reasonable.</para>

<para>Here are some motivating examples.  The commands will be
explained in more detail after the description of selection
syntax.</para>

<programlisting>
edit :15                     ;; edit the object associated with mark :15

index 29..71                 ;; list summary index of events 20..71

delete =t &amp; 1..:97           ;; delete tags from event 1 to mark 15
</programlisting>

<para>The selection-set specification syntax is an expression-oriented 
minilanguage.  The most basic term in this language is a 
<firstterm>location</firstterm>. The following sorts of primitive locations
are supported:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><firstterm>event numbers</firstterm></term>
<listitem><para>A plain numeric literal is interpreted as a 1-origin
event-sequence number.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><firstterm>marks</firstterm></term>
<listitem><para>A numeric literal preceded by a colon is interpreted
as a mark; see the format documentation for explanation of the 
semantics of marks.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>These may be grouped into sets in the following ways:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><firstterm>ranges</firstterm></term>
<listitem><para>A range is two locations separated by "..", and is
the set of events begining at the left-hand location and ending at the
right-hand location (inclusive).</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<term><firstterm>lists</firstterm></term>
<listitem><para>Comma-separated lists of locations and ranges are 
accepted, with the obvious meaning.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>There are some other ways to construct event sets:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><firstterm>visibility sets</firstterm></term>
<listitem>
<para>A visibility set is an expression specifying a set of event
types. It will consist of a leading plus, minus, or equal sign,
followed by type letters. These are the type letters:</para>

<command>progress</command>, the <command>options</command>, and
<command>checkpoint</command> commands as well as comments led by
#.</para>

<para>Guarantee: All <application>reposurgeon</application> operations either
preserve all repository state they are not explicitly told to modify
or warn you when they cannot do so.</para>

<para>Limitation: Because <application>reposurgeon</application>
relies on other programs to generate and imterpret the fast-import command
stream, it is subject to bugs in those prograns.</para>

<para>Limitation: Under version-control systems other than git,
fast-import format may not capture the entire repository
state. Presently the only known limitations are:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Under bzr, dumps do not capture information about (a) multiple-author 
commits, (b) bzr custom commit properties (e.g. branch-nick and bugs 
fixed by this change), or (c) empty directories.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Limitation: Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't directly supported because exporting
from them requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to
full email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
transform repo-command streams and cope with the export/import
separately.</para>

<para>Guarantee: As version-control systems add support for the
fast-import format, their repositories will become editable by
<application>reposurgeon</application>. See the <ulink
url="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/InterfacesFrontendsAndTools">Git
Wiki tools page</ulink> for a large collection of such tools.</para>

Switch selection sets from prefix to postfix.

The prefix position what triggering some obscure bug in the Python cmd
class; the symptom was that "$ verbose" wouldn't parse properly.

# All knowledge about specific version-control systems lives in the
# following dictionary. The key is the subdirectory name that tells us
# we have a given VCS active.  The values in the tuple are,
# respectively:
#
# * Name of the SCM for diagnostic messages
# * Command to export from the SCM to the interchange format
# * Command to initialize a new repo
# * Command to import from the interchange format
# * Command to check out working copies of the repo files.
#
# Note that some of the commands used here are plugins or extenstions
# that are not part of the basic VCS. Thus these may fail when called;
# we need to be prepared to cope with that.
#
# Subversion/RCS/CVS aren't in this table because exporting from them
# requires fixups of usernames in the committer information to full
# email addresses.  Trying to handle that entirely inside this tool
# would be excessively messy, so we don't. Instead we let the user
# transform dump files and cope with the export/import himself.
