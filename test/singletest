singletest - run a single regression test

The REPOSURGEON environment variable can be used to substitute in a
different implementation.

With -h, display this option summary.

With -o, domp the test output rather than diffing against the checkfile

With -s, set the serial flag to disable parallelism

With -x, set the experimental flag.
