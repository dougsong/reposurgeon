# This test can fail spuriously due to format skew.  Kevin Caswick
# explains:
# > Note: Test repotool export of svn repo fails on svnadmin, version
# > 1.6.11 as the dump is sorted differently, moving svn:log before
# > svn:author instead of after svn:date. It works fine on svnadmin,
# > version 1.8.10.
