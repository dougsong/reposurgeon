singlelift - run a single Subversion conversion test

With -h, display this option summary.

With -l, set reposurgeon log flags (dump mode only).

With -s, force serial execution - disables parallelism.

With -o, dump the conversion to stdout rather than diffing against
the check file.

With -x, set the experimental flag.

The REPOSURGEON environment variable can be used to substitute in a
different implementation.
