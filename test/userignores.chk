This repository is designed to demonstrate an oversight in the way
reposurgeon handles ignores and the case of pre-existing .gitignore
files in a Subversion repository. This is not an uncommon case with
git-svn users operating with a repository.

Add a custom .gitignore file

This simulates the case of a git-svn user wishing to ignore *.txt
files, without adding them to Subversion's native svn:ignore property.

Branch trunk to cool-feature

This causes reposurgeon to replace the custom .gitignore with only the
contents of svn:ignore.

This repository is designed to demonstrate an oversight in the way
reposurgeon handles ignores and the case of pre-existing .gitignore
files in a Subversion repository. This is not an uncommon case with
git-svn users operating with a repository.

What should happen is that reposurgeon should do its best to merge the
contents of the .gitignore -- possibly .hgignore or any other kind of
ignore that conflicts with the target VCS -- with those of the
svn:ignore: in fact, this should be general enough to handle the case
of from-any-VCS to-any-target-VCS, but Subversion->Git is being used
as the example here.

The expected results as of this commit, is that the .gitignore should
include the default svn:ignore properties, *.html, and *.txt. *.html
coming from svn:ignore and *.txt coming from the stored-in-svn
.gitignore
