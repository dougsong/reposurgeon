[[description]]
== DESCRIPTION ==

The purpose of reposurgeon is to enable risky operations that VCSes
(version-control systems) don't want to let you do, such as (a)
editing past comments and metadata, (b) excising commits, (c)
coalescing and splitting commits, (d) removing files and subtrees from
repo history, (e) merging or grafting two or more repos, and (f)
cutting a repo in two by cutting a parent-child link, preserving the
branch structure of both child repos.

A major use of reposurgeon is to assist a human operator to
perform higher-quality conversions among version control systems than
can be achieved with fully automated converters.

The original motivation for reposurgeon was
to clean up artifacts created by repository conversions.  It was
foreseen that the tool would also have applications when code needs to
be removed from repositories for legal or policy reasons.

To keep reposurgeon simple and flexible, it
normally does not do its own repository reading and writing.  Instead, it
relies on being able to parse and emit the command streams created by
git-fast-export and read by git-fast-import.  This means that it can
be used on any version-control system that has both fast-export
and fast-import utilities. The git-import stream format also implicitly
defines a common language of primitive operations for
reposurgeon to speak.

Fully supported systems (those for which reposurgeon can both read and
write repositories) include git, hg, bzr, darcs, bk, RCS, and SRC.
For a complete list, with dependencies and technical notes, type
"prefer" to the reposurgeon prompt.

Writing to the file-oriented systems RCS and SRC is done via
rcs-fast-import(1) and has some serious limitations because those
systems cannot represent all the metadata in a git-fast-export
stream. Consult that tool's documentation for details and partial
workarounds.

Fossil repository files can be read in using the --format=fossil
option of the "read" command and written out with the --format=fossil
option of the +write+. Ignore patterns are not
translated in either direction.

SVN and CVS are supported for read only, not write.  For CVS,
reposurgeon must be run from within a repository
directory (one with a CVSROOT subdirectory). Each module becomes
a subdirectory in the the reposurgeon
representation of the change history.

In order to deal with version-control systems that do not have
fast-export equivalents, reposurgeon can also host extractor code that
reads repositories directly.  For each version-control system
supported through an extractor, reposurgeon uses a small amount of
knowledge about the system's command-line tools to (in effect) replay
repository history into an input stream internally. Repositories under
systems supported through extractors can be read by reposurgeon, but
not modified by it.  In particular, reposurgeon can be used to move a
repository history from any VCS supported by an extractor to any VCS
supported by a normal importer/exporter pair.

Mercurial repository reading is implemented with an extractor
class; writing is handled with the stock "hg fastimport" command.  A
test extractor exists for git, but is normally disabled in favor of
the regular exporter.

For guidance on the pragmatics of repository conversion, see the
http://www.catb.org/esr/dvcs-migration-guide.html[DVCS Migration HOWTO].

[[warning]]
== SAFETY WARNINGS ==

reposurgeon is a sharp enough tool to cut you.  It takes care not to
ever write a repository in an actually inconsistent state, and will
terminate with an error message rather than proceed when its internal
data structures are confused.  However, there are lots of things you
can do with it - like altering stored commit timestamps so they no
longer match the commit sequence - that are likely to cause havoc
after you're done.  Proceed with caution and check your work.

Also note that, if your DVCS does the usual thing of making
commit IDs a cryptographic hash of content and parent links, editing a
publicly-accessible repository with this tool would be a bad idea. All
of the surgical operations in reposurgeon will
modify the hash chains.

Please also see the notes on system-specific issues under
<<limitations>>.

[[options]]
== OPERATION ==

The program can be run in one of two modes, either as an
interactive command interpreter or in batch mode to execute commands
given as arguments on the reposurgeon invocation
line. The only differences between these modes are (1) the interactive
one begins by turning on the 'interactive' option, (2) in batch mode all
errors (including normally recoverable errors in selection-set syntax)
are fatal, and (3) each command-line argument beginning with
"--" has that stripped off (which, in particular means
that --help and --version will work as expected). Also, in interactive
mode, Ctrl-P and Ctrl-N will be available to scroll through your
command history and tab completion of both command keywords and name
arguments (wherever that makes semantic sense) is available.

A git-fast-import stream consists of a sequence of commands
which must be executed in the specified sequence to build the repo; to
avoid confusion with reposurgeon commands
we will refer to the stream commands as _events_ in
this documentation.  These events are implicitly numbered from 1
upwards.  Most commands require specifying a selection of event
sequence numbers so reposurgeon will know
which events to modify or delete.

For all the details of event types and semantics, see the
git-fast-import(1) manual page; the rest of this paragraph is a quick
start for the impatient. Most events in a stream are *commits*
describing revision states of the repository; these group together
under a single change comment one or more *fileops* (file operations),
which usually point to *blobs* that are revision states of individual
files. A fileop may also be a delete operation indicating that a
specified previously-existing file was deleted as part of the version
commit; there are a couple of other special fileop types of lesser
importance.

Commands to reposurgeon consist of a command keyword, sometimes
preceded by a selection set, sometimes followed by
whitespace-separated arguments. It is often possible to omit the
selection-set argument and have it default to something reasonable.

Here are some motivating examples.  The commands will be
explained in more detail after the description of selection
syntax.

--------

The regular expressions should be in
https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax[Golang's] format, with one
exception. Due to a conflist with the use of $ for arguments in the
script command, we retain Python's use of backslashes as a leader for
references to group matches.

[[selections]]
=== SELECTION SYNTAX ===

A selection set is ordered; that is, any given element may occur
only one, and the set is ordered by when its members were first added.

The selection-set specification syntax is an expression-oriented
minilanguage.  The most basic term in this language is a
location. The following sorts of primitive locations
are supported:

event numbers::
   A plain numeric literal is interpreted as a 1-origin
   event-sequence number.

marks::
   A numeric literal preceded by a colon is interpreted
   as a mark; see the import stream format documentation for explanation
   of the semantics of marks.

tag and branch names::
   The basename of a branch (including branches in the refs/tags
   namespace) refers to its tip commit.  The name of a tag is equivalent
   to its mark (that of the tag itself, not the commit it refers to). Tag
   and branch locations are bracketed with < > (angle brackets) to
   distinguish them from command keywords.

legacy IDs::
   If the contents of name brackets (< >) does not match a tag or
   branch name, the interpreter next searches legacy IDs of commits.  This
   is especially useful when you have imported a Subversion dump; it
   means that commits made from it can be referred to by their corresponding
   Subversion revision numbers.

commit numbers::
   A numeric literal within  name brackets (< >)
   preceded by # is interpreted as a 1-origin
   commit-sequence number.

reset@ names::
   A name with the prefix 'reset@' refers to the latest reset with a
   basename matching the part after the @. Usually there is only one such
   reset.

$::
   Refers to the last event.

These may be grouped into sets in the following ways:

ranges::
   A range is two locations separated by "..", and is
   the set of events beginning at the left-hand location and ending at the
   right-hand location (inclusive).

lists::
   Comma-separated lists of locations and ranges are
   accepted, with the obvious meaning.

There are some other ways to construct event sets:

visibility sets::
   A visibility set is an expression specifying a set of event
   types. It will consist of a leading equal sign, followed by type
   letters. These are the type letters:
+
[options=""]
|===================================================================
| B | blobs                           | Most default selection sets
                                        exclude blobs; they have to
                                        be manipulated through the 
					commits they are attached to.
| C | commits                         |
| D | all-delete commits              | These are artifacts produced by some older
	                                repository-conversion tools.
| H | head (branch tip) commits       |
| O | orphaned (parentless) commits   |
| U | commits with callout parents    |
| Z | commits with no fileops         |
| M | merge (multi-parent) commits    |
| F | fork (multi-child) commits      |
| L | commits with unclean multi-line comments |  E.g. without a separating empty line after the first
| I | commits for which metadata cannot be decoded to UTF-8 |
| T | tags                            |
| R | resets                          |
| P | passthroughs                    | All event types simply passed through,
                                        including comments, +progress+ commands,
                                        and +checkpoint+ commands
| N | Legacy IDs                      | Any comment matching a cookie (legacy-ID) format.
|===================================================================

references::
   A reference name (bracketed by angle brackets) resolves
   to a single object, either a commit or tag.
+
[options="header"]
|===================================================================
| type          | interpretation
| tag name      | annotated tag with that name
| branch name   | the branch tip commit
| legacy ID     | commit with that legacy ID
| assigned name | name equated to a selection by assign
|===================================================================
+
Note that if an annotated tag and a branch have the same name foo,
<foo> will resolve to the tag rather than the branch tip commit.

dates and action stamps::
   A date or action stamp in angle brackets resolves
   to a selection set of all matching commits.
+
[options="header"]
|===================================================================
| type                           | interpretation
| RFC3339 timestamp              | commit or tag with that time/date
| action stamp (timestamp!email) | commits or tags with that timestamp and
                                   author (or committer if no
				   author).  Aliases of the author
	                           are also accepted.
| yyyy-mm-dd part of RFC3339 timestamp | all commits and tags with that date
|===================================================================
+
To refine the match to a single commit, use a 1-origin index
suffix separated  by '#'. Thus "<2000-02-06T09:35:10Z>" can
match multiple commits, but "<2000-02-06T09:35:10Z#2>" matches
only the second in the set.

text search::
    A text search expression is a regular expression
    surrounded by forward slashes (to embed a forward slash in it, use a
    C-like string escape such as \x2f).
+
A text search normally matches against the comment fields of commits and
annotated tags, or against their author/committer names, or against
the names of tags; also the text of passthrough objects.
+
The scope of a text search can be changed with qualifier
letters after the trailing slash.  These are as follows:
+
[options="header"]
|===================================================================
| letter   | interpretation
| a        | author name in commit
| b        | branch name in commit; also matches
             blobs referenced by commits on matching branches, and tags
             which point to commmits on matching branches.
| c        | comment text of commit or tag
| r        | committish reference in tag or reset
| p        | text in passthrough
| t        | tagger in tag
| n        | name of tag
| B        | blob content
|===================================================================
+
Multiple qualifier letters can add more search scopes.
+
(The "b" qualifier replaces the branchset syntax
in earlier versions of reposurgeon.)

paths::
   A "path expression" enclosed in square brackets resolves to the
   set of all commits and blobs related to a path matching the given
   expression. The path expression itself is either a path literal or a
   regular expression surrounded by slashes. Immediately after the
   trailing / of a path regexp you can put any number of the following
   characters which act as flags: 'a', 'c', 'D', "M', 'R', 'C', 'N'.
+
By default, a path is related to a commit if the latter has a
fileop that touches that file path - modifies that change it, deletes
that remove it, renames and copies that have it as a source or
target. When the 'c' flag is in use the meaning changes: the paths
related to a commit become all paths that would be present in a
checkout for that commit.
+
A path literal matches a commit if and only if the path literal is
exactly one of the paths related to the commit (no prefix or suffix operation
is done). In particular a path literal won't match if it corresponds to a
directory in the chosen repository.
+
A regular expression matches a commit if it matches any path related to
the commit anywhere in the path. You can use '^' or '$' if you want the
expression to only match at the beginning or end of paths.  When the 'a' flag is
in use, the path expression selects commits whose every path matches the regular
expression. This is not always a subset of commits selected without the 'a'
flag because it also selects commits with no related paths (e.g. empty commits,
deletealls and commits with empty trees). If you want to avoid those, you can
use e.g. '[/regex/] &amp; [/regex/a]'.
+
The flags 'D', "M', 'R', 'C', 'N' restrict match checking to the
corresponding fileop types.  Note that this means an 'a' match is
easier (not harder) to achieve.  These are no-ops when used with 'c'.
+
A path or literal matches a blob if it matches any path that
appeared in a modification fileop that referred to that blob. To
select purely matching blobs or matching commits, compose a path
expression with =B or =C.
+
If you need to embed '[^/]' into your regular expression (e.g. to
express "all characters but a slash") you can use a C-like string
escape such as \x2f.

function calls::
   The expression language has named special functions.  The sequence for
   a named function is "@" followed by a function name,
   followed by an argument in parentheses. Presently the following
   functions are defined:
+
[options="header"]
|===================================================================
| name   | interpretation
| min    | minimum member of a selection set
| max    | maximum member of a selection set
| amp    | nonempty selection set becomes all
           objects, empty set is returned empty
| par    | all parents of commits in the
	   argument set
| chn    | all children of commits in the
	   argument set
| dsc    | all commits descended from the
	   argument set (argument set included)
| anc    | all commits whom the argument set is
	   descended from (argument set included)
| pre    | events before the argument set;
           empty if the argument set includes
           the first event.
| suc    | events after the argument set;
           empty if the argument set includes
           the last event.
| srt    | sort the argument set
	   by event number.
|===================================================================

Set expressions may be combined with the operators | and &amp;
which are, respectively, set union and intersection. The | has lower
precedence than intersection, but you may use parentheses '(' and
')' to group expressions in case there is ambiguity (this replaces the
curly brackets used in older versions of the syntax).

Any set operation may be followed by '?' to add the set
members' neighbors and referents.  This extends the set to include the
parents and children of all commits in the set, and the referents of
any tags and resets in the set. Each blob reference in the set is
replaced by all commit events that refer to it. The '?' can be repeated
to extend the neighborhood depth.  The result of a '?' extension is
sorted so the result is in ascending order.

Do set negation with prefix ~; it has higher precedence than
&amp; and | but lower than ?

[[import-export]]
=== IMPORT AND EXPORT ===

reposurgeon can hold multiple repository
states in core.  Each has a name.  At any given time, one may be selected
for editing. Commands in this group import repositories, export them,
and manipulate the in-core list and the selection.

+read+ [ +--format=fossil+ ] [ _directory_ | +-+ | _<infile_ ]::
    With a directory-name argument, this command attempts
    to read in the contents of a repository in any supported
    version-control system under that directory; read with no arguments
    does this in the current directory. If output is redirected to a
    plain file, it will be read in as a fast-import stream or Subversion
    dumpfile. With an argument of "-", this command reads a
    fast-import stream or Subversion dumpfile from standard input (this
    will be useful in filters constructed with command-line
    arguments).
+
If the contents is a fast-import stream, any "cvs-revision" property
on a commit is taken to be a newline-separated list of CVS revision cookies
pointing to the commit, and used for reference lifting.
+
If the contents is a fast-import stream, any "legacy-id" property
on a commit is taken to be a legacy ID token pointing to the commit,
and used for reference-lifting.
+
If the read location is a git repository and contains a
_.git/cvsauthors_ file (such as is left in place
by +git cvsimport -A+) that file will be read in as
if it had been given to the +authors read+ command.
+
If the read location is a directory, and its repository
subdirectory has a file named _legacy-map_, that file
will be read as though passed to a _legacy read_
command.
+
If the read location is a file and the --format=fossil
is used, the file is interpreted as a Fossil repository.
+
The --preserve is interpreted in a way
dependent of the type of the incoming repository or stream. Presently
it only affects the processing of Subversion repositories; see
<xref linkend='subversion'/> for details.
+
The just-read-in repo is added to the list of loaded
repositories and becomes the current one, selected for surgery. If it
was read from a plain file and the file name ends with one of the
extensions _.fi_ or _.svn_, that
extension is removed from the load list name.
+
Note: this command does not take a selection set.

+write+ [ +--legacy+ ] [ +--format=fossil+ ] [ +--noincremental+ ] [ +--callout+ ] [ _>outfile_ |_-_ ]::
   Dump selected events as a fast-import stream representing the
   edited repository; the default selection set is all events. Where to
   dump to is standard output if there is no argument or the argument is
   '-', or the target of an output redirect. 
+
Alternatively, if there is no redirect and the argument names a
directory, the repository is rebuilt into that directory, with any
selection set being ignored; if that target directory is nonempty its
contents are backed up to a save directory.
+
If the write location is a file and the
--format=fossil is used, the file is written in
Fossil repository format.
+
With the --legacy option, the Legacy-ID of
each commit is appended to its commit comment at write time. This
option is mainly useful for debugging conversion edge cases.
+
If you specify a partial selection set such that some commits
are included but their parents are not, the output will include
incremental dump cookies for each branch with an origin outside the
selection set, just before the first reference to that branch in a
commit.  An incremental dump cookie looks like "refs/heads/foo^0" and
is a clue to export-stream loaders that the branch should be glued to
the tip of a pre-existing branch of the same name.  The
--noincremental option suppresses this behavior.
+
When you specify a partial selection set, including a commit
object forces the inclusion of every blob to which it refers and
every tag that refers to it.
+
Specifying a partial selection may cause a situation in which
some parent marks in merges don't correspond to commits present in the
dump.  When this happens and --callout option was
specified, the write code replaces the merge mark with a callout, the
action stamp of the parent commit; otherwise the parent mark is
omitted.  Importers will fail when reading a stream dump with callouts;
it is intended to be used by the +graft+
command.
+
Specifying a write selection set with gaps in it is allowed
but unlikely to lead to good results if it is loaded by an importer.
+
Property extensions will be be omitted from the output if the
importer for the preferred repository type cannot digest them.
+
Note: to examine small groups of commits without the progress
meter, use +inspect+.

+choose+ [ _reponame_ ]::
   Choose a named repo on which to operate.  The name of a repo is
   normally the basename of the directory or file it was loaded from, but
   repos loaded from standard input are "unnamed".
   reposurgeon will add a disambiguating
   suffix if there have been multiple reads from the same source.
+
With no argument, lists the names of the currently stored
repositories and their load times.  The second column is '*' for the
currently selected repository, '-' for others.

+drop+ [ _reponame_ ]::
   Drop a repo named by the argument from reposurgeon's list,
   freeing the memory used for its metadata and deleting on-disk
   blobs. With no argument, drops the currently chosen repo.

+rename+ _reponame_::
   Rename the currently chosen repo; requires an argument.  Won't
   do it if there is already one by the new name.

[[rebuild]]
=== REBUILDS IN PLACE ===

reposurgeon can rebuild an altered repository
in place.  Untracked files are normally saved and restored when the
contents of the new repository is checked out (but see the
documentation of the "preserve" command for a
caveat).

+rebuild+ [ _directory_ ]::
   Rebuild a repository from the state held by
   reposurgeon.  This command does not take a
   selection set.
+
The single argument, if present, specifies the target directory in
which to do the rebuild; if the repository read was from a repo
directory (and not a git-import stream), it defaults to that
directory.  If the target directory is nonempty its contents are
backed up to a save directory.  Files and directories on the
repository's preserve list are copied back from the backup directory
after repo rebuild. The default preserve list depends on the
repository type, and can be displayed with the +stats+ command.
+
If reposurgeon has a nonempty legacy map,
it will be written to a file named _legacy-map_
in the repository subdirectory as though by a
_legacy write_ command. (This will normally
be the case for Subversion and CVS conversions.)

+preserve+ [ _file..._ ]::
   Add (presumably untracked) files or directories to the repo's
   list of paths to be restored from the backup directory after a
   +rebuild+. Each argument, if any, is interpreted as a
   pathname.  The current preserve list is displayed afterwards.
+
It is only necessary to use this feature if your version-control
system lacks a command to list files under version control. Under
systems with such a command (which include git and hg), all files that
are neither beneath the repository dot directory nor under reposurgeon
temporary directories are preserved automatically.

+unpreserve+ [ _file..._ ]::
   Remove (presumably untracked) files or directories to
   the repo's list of paths to be restored from the backup directory
   after a +rebuild+. Each argument, if any, is
   interpreted as a pathname.  The current preserve list is displayed
   afterwards.

[[timequakes]]
=== TIMEQUAKES AND TIMEBUMPS ===

Modifying a repository so every commit in it has a unique
timestamp is often a useful thing to do, in order for every commit has
a unique action stamp that can be referred to in surgical
commands.

+timequake+::
   Attempt to hack committer and author time stamps in the
   selection set (defaulting to all commits in the repository) to be
   unique.  Works by identifying collisions between parent and child,
   than incrementing child timestamps so they no longer coincide. Won't
   touch commits with multiple parents.
+
Because commits are checked in ascending order, this logic will
normally do the right thing on chains of three or more commits with
identical timestamps.
+ 
Any timestamp collisions left after this operation are probably
cross-branch and have to be individually dealt with using 'timebump'
commands.

+timebump+ [ _seconds_ ]::
   Bump the committer and author timestamps of commits in the selection
   set (defaulting to empty) by one second.   With following integer argument,
   that many seconds. Argument may be negative.
+
Those of you twitchy about "rewriting history" should bear in
mind that the commit stamps in many older repositories were never very
reliable to begin with.
+
CVS in particular is notorious for shipping client-side
timestamps with timezone and DST issues (as opposed to UTC) that don't
necessary compare well with stamps from different clients of the same
CVS server. Thus, inducing a timequake in a CVS repo seldom produces
effects anywhere near as large than the measurement noise of the
repository's own timestamps.
+
Subversion was somewhat better about this, as commits were
stamped at the server, but older Subversion repositories often have
sections that predate the era of ubiquitous NTP time.

[[information]]
=== INFORMATION AND REPORTS ===

Commands in this group report information about the selected
repository.

The output of these commands can individually be redirected to
a named output file. Where indicated in the syntax, you can prefix the
output filename with ">" and give it as a following
argument.  If you use ">>" the file is opened
for append rather than write.

+list+ [ >__outfile__ ]::
   This is the main command for identifying the events
   you want to modify.  It lists commits in the selection set by event
   sequence number with summary information. The first column is raw
   event numbers, the second a timestamp in local time. If the repository
   has legacy IDs, they will be displayed in the third column. The
   leading portion of the comment follows.

+stamp+ [ >__outfile__ ]::
   Alternative form of listing that displays full action
   stamps, usable as references in selections. Supports >
   redirection.

+tip+ [ >__outfile__ ]::
   Display the branch tip names associated with commits
   in the selection set.  These will not necessarily be the same as their
   branch fields (which will often be tag names if the repo contains
   either annotated or lightweight tags).
+
If a commit is at a branch tip, its tip is its branch name.  If
it has only one child, its tip is the child's tip.  If it has multiple
children, then if there is a child with a matching branch name its tip
is the child's tip.  Otherwise this function throws a recoverable
error.

+tags+ [>__outfile__ ]::
   Display tags and resets: three fields, an event number and a type and a name.
   Branch tip commits associated with tags are also displayed with the type
   field 'commit'. Supports > redirection.

+stats+ [ __repo-name__...] [>__outfile__ ]::
   Report size statistics and import/export method information about
   named repositories, or with no argument the currently chosen repository.

+count+ [>__outfile__ ]::
   Report a count of items in the selection set. Default set is everything
   in the currently-selected repo. Supports > redirection.

+inspect+ [>__outfile__ ]::
   Dump a fast-import stream representing selected events to standard
   output.  Just like a write, except (1) the progress meter is disabled,
   and (2) there is an identifying header before each event dump.

+graph+ [>__outfile__ ]::
   Emit a visualization of the commit graph in the DOT markup language
   used by the graphviz tool suite.  This can be fed as input to the main
   graphviz rendering program dot(1), which will yield a viewable
   image. Supports > redirection.
+
You may find a script like this useful:
+
----
graph $1 >/tmp/foo$$
shell dot </tmp/foo$$ -Tpng | display -; rm /tmp/foo$$
----
+
You can substitute in your own preferred image viewer, of course.

+sizes+ [>__outfile__ ]::
   Print a report on data volume per branch; takes a selection set,
   defaulting to all events. The numbers tally the size of uncompressed
   blobs, commit and tag comments, and other metadata strings (a blob is
   counted each time a commit points at it). 
+
The numbers are not an exact measure of storage size: they are
intended mainly as a way to get information on how to efficiently
partition a repository that has become large enough to be
unwieldy.

+lint+ [>__outfile__ ]::
   Look for DAG and metadata configurations that may indicate a
   problem. Presently checks for: (1) Mid-branch deletes, (2)
   disconnected commits, (3) parentless commits, (4) the existence of
   multiple roots, (5) committer and author IDs that don't look
   well-formed as DVCS IDs, (6) multiple child links with identical
   branch labels descending from the same commit, (7) time and
   action-stamp collisions.
+
Options to issue only partial reports are supported; "lint
--options" or "lint -?" lists them.
+
The options and output format of this command are unstable; they may
change without notice as more sanity checks are added.

+when+ _timespec_
   Interconvert between git timestamps (integer Unix time plus TZ) and
   RFC3339 format.  Takes one argument, autodetects the format.  Useful
   when eyeballing export streams.  Also accepts any other supported
   date format and converts to RFC3339.

[[surgical]]
=== SURGICAL OPERATIONS ===

These are the operations the rest of reposurgeon is designed
to support.

+squash+ [ _policy..._ ]::
   Combine or delete commits in a selection set of events. The
   default selection set for this command is empty. Has no effect on
   events other than commits unless the --delete policy is selected;
   see the 'delete' command for discussion.
+
Normally, when a commit is squashed, its file operation list
(and any associated blob references) gets either prepended to the
beginning of the operation list of each of the commit's children or
appended to the operation list of each of the commit's parents. Then
children of a deleted commit get it removed from their parent set and
its parents added to their parent set.
+
The analogous operation is performed on commit comments, so no
comment text is ever outright discarded.  Exception: comments
consisting of "*** empty log messages ***", as generated by
CVS, are ignored.
+
The default is to squash forward, modifying children; but see the
list of policy modifiers below for how to change this.
+
WARNING: It is easy to get the bounds of a squash command wrong, with
   confusing and destructive results. Beware thinking you can squash on a
   selection set to merge all commits except the last one into the last
   one; what you will actually do is to merge all of them to the first
   commit _after_ the selected set.
+
Normally, any tag pointing to a combined commit will also be
pushed forward.  But see the list of policy modifiers below for how to
change this.
+
Following all operation moves, every one of the altered file
operation lists is reduced to a shortest normalized form. The
normalized form detects various combinations of modification,
deletion, and renaming and simplifies the operation sequence as much
as it can without losing any information.
+
After canonicalization, a file op list may still end up containing
multiple M operations on the same file. Normally the tool utters a
warning when this occurs but does not try to resolve it.
+
The following modifiers change these policies:
+
|===================================================================
| --delete      | Simply discards all file ops and tags associated with deleted commit(s).
| --coalesce    | Discard all M operations (and associated blobs) except the last.
| --pushback    | Append fileops to parents, rather than prepending to children.
| --pushforward | Prepend fileops to children. This is the default; it can be
                  specified in a lift script for explicitness about intentions.
| --tagforward  | With the "tagforward" modifier, any tag on the deleted commit is pushed
                  forward to the first child rather than being deleted. This is the
                  default; it can be specified for explicitness.
| --tagback     | With the "--tagback" modifier, any tag on the deleted commit is pushed
                  backward to the first parent rather than being deleted. 
| --quiet       | Suppresses warning messages about deletion of commits with
                  non-delete fileops.
| --complain    | The opposite of quiet. Can be specified for explicitness.
| --empty-only  | Complain if a squash operation modifies a nonempty comment.
|===================================================================
+
Under any of these policies except "--delete",
deleting a commit that has children does not back out the changes made
by that commit, as they will still be present in the blobs attached to
versions past the end of the deletion set.  All a delete does when the
commit has children is lose the metadata information about when and by
who those changes were actually made; after the delete any such
changes will be attributed to the first undeleted children of the
deleted commits.  It is expected that this command will be useful
mainly for removing commits mechanically generated by repository
converters such as +cvs2svn+.

+delete+ [ _policy..._ ]::
   Delete a selection set of events. The default selection set for
   this command is empty. On a set of commits, this is equivalent to a
   squash with the --delete flag.  It unconditionally deletes tags,
   resets, and passthroughs; blobs can be removed only as a side effect
   of deleting every commit that points at them.


+divide+  _parent_ [ _child_ ]::
   Attempt to partition a repo by cutting the parent-child link
   between two specified commits (they must be adjacent). Does not take a
   general selection set.  It is only necessary to specify the
   parent commit, unless it has multiple children in which case the child
   commit must follow (separate it with a comma).
+
If the repo was named 'foo', you will normally end up with two
repos named 'foo-early' and 'foo-late' (option and feature events at
the beginning of the early segment will be duplicated onto the
beginning of the late one.).  But if the commit graph would remain
connected through another path after the cut, the behavior changes.
In this case, if the parent and child were on the same branch 'qux',
the branch segments are renamed 'qux-early' and 'qux-late' but
the repo is not divided.

+expunge+ [ +--notagify+ ] [ _path_ | /__regexp__/ ]...::
   Expunge files from the selected portion of the repo history; the
   default is the entire history.  The arguments to this command may be
   paths or regular expressions matching paths (regexps must
   be marked by being surrounded with //).
+
All filemodify (M) operations and delete (D) operations
involving a matched file in the selected set of events are
disconnected from the repo and put in a removal set.  Renames are
followed as the tool walks forward in the selection set; each triggers
a warning message. If a selected file is a copy (C) target, the copy
will be deleted and a warning message issued. If a selected file is a
copy source, the copy target will be added to the list of paths to be
deleted and a warning issued.
+
After file expunges have been performed, any commits with no
remaining file operations will be removed, and any tags pointing to
them. By default each deleted commit is replaced with a tag of the form
'emptycommit-_ident_' on the preceding commit unless
"--notagify" is specified as an argument. Commits with deleted
fileops pointing both in and outside the path set are not deleted, but are
cloned into the removal set.
+
The removal set is not discarded. It is assembled into a new
repository named after the old one with the suffix "-expunges" added.
Thus, this command can be used to carve a repository into sections by
file path matches.

+tagify+ [ +--canonicalize+ ] [ +--tipdeletes+ ] [ +--tagify-merges+ ]::
   Search for empty commits and turn them into tags. Takes an optional
   selection set argument defaulting to all commits. For each commit in the
   selection set, turn it into a tag with the same message and author information
   if it has no fileops. By default merge commits are not considered, even if they
   have no fileops (thus no tree differences with their first parent). To change
   that, use the --tagify-merges option.
+
The name of the generated tag will be 'emptycommit-__ident__', where
_ident_ is generated from the legacy ID of the deleted commit, or from
its mark, or from its index in the repository, with a disambiguation
suffix if needed.
+
With the --canonicalize, tagify tries harder to detect
trivial commits by first ensuring that all fileops of selected commits will
have an actual effect when processed by fast-import.
+
With the --tipdeletes, tagify also considers branch tips
with only deleteall fileops to be candidates for tagification. The
corresponding tags get names of the form
'tipdelete-_branchname_' rather than the default
'emptycommit-_ident_'.
+
With the --tagify-merges, tagify also tagifies merge
commits that have no fileops. When this is done the merge link is move to the
yagified commit's parent.

+coalesce+ [ +--debug+ | +--changelog+ ] [ _timefuzz_ ]::
   Scan the selection set for runs of commits with identical
   comments close to each other in time (this is a common form of scar
   tissues in repository up-conversions from older file-oriented
   version-control systems).  Merge these cliques by deleting all but the
   last commit, in order; fileops from the deleted commits are pushed
   forward to that last one
+
The optional second argument, if present, is a maximum time
separation in seconds; the default is 90 seconds.
+
The default selection set for this command is =C, all
commits. Occasionally you may want to restrict it, for example to
avoid coalescing unrelated cliques of "*** empty log message ***"
commits from CVS lifts.
+
With  the --debug option, show messages about mismatches.
+
With the --changelog option, any commit with a comment
containing the string 'empty log message' (such as is generated by
CVS) and containing exactly one file operation modifying a path ending
in _ChangeLog_ is treated specially.  Such
ChangeLog commits are considered to match any commit before them by
content, and will coalesce with it if the committer matches and the
commit separation is small enough.  This option handles a convention
used by Free Software Foundation projects.

+split+ +{at|by}+ _item_ ::
    The first argument is required to be a commit location; the second is
    a preposition which indicates which splitting method to use. If the
    preposition is 'at', then the third argument must be an integer
    1-origin index of a file operation within the commit. If it is 'by',
    then the third argument must be a pathname to be prefix-matched,
    pathname match is done first).
+
The commit is copied and inserted into a new position in the
event sequence, immediately following itself; the duplicate becomes
the child of the original, and replaces it as parent of the original's
children. Commit metadata is duplicated; the new commit then gets a
new mark. If the new commit has a legacy ID, the suffix '.split' is
appended to it.
+
Finally, some file operations - starting at the one matched or
indexed by the split argument - are moved forward from the original
commit into the new one.  Legal indices are 2-n, where n is the number
of file operations in the original commit.

[[reference-lifting]]
=== REFERENCE LIFTING ===

This group of commands is meant for fixing up references in commits
that are in the format of older version control systems.  The general
workflow is this: first, go over the comment history and change all
old-fashioned commit references into machine-parseable cookies.  Then,
automatically turn the machine-parseable cookie into action stamps.
The point of dividing the process this way is that the first part is
hard for a machine to get right, while the second part is prone to errors
when a human does it.

A Subversion cookie is a comment substring of the form
\[[SVN:ddddd]] (example: \[[SVN:2355]] with the revision read directly
via the Subversion exporter, deduced from git-svn metadata, or
matching a $Revision$ header embedded in blob data for the
filename.

A CVS cookie is a comment substring of the form
\[[CVS:filename:revision]] (example: \[[CVS:src/README:1.23]] with the
revision matching a CVS $Id$ or $Revision$ header embedded in blob
data for the filename.

A mark cookie is of the form [[:dddd]] and is simply a reference
to the specified mark. You may want to hand-patch this in when one of
previous forms is inconvenient.

An action stamp is an RFC3339 timestamp, followed by a '!',
followed by an author email address (author is preferred rather than
committer because that timestamp is not changed when a patch is
replayed on to a branch, but the code to make a stamp for a commit
will fall back to the committer if no author field is present).  It
attempts to refer to a commit without being VCS-specific.
Thus, instead of "commit 304a53c2" or "r2355",
"2011-10-25T15:11:09Z!fred@foonly.com".

The following git aliases allow git to work directly with action
stamps.  Append it to your _~/.gitconfig_; if you
already have an [alias] section, leave off the first line.

// Keep this updated from reposurgeon-git-aliases
--------
[alias]
	# git stamp <commit-ish> - print a reposurgeon-style action stamp
	stamp = show -s --format='%cI!%ce'

	# git scommit <stamp> <rev-list-args> - list most recent commit that matches <stamp>.
	# Must also specify a branch to search or --all, after these arguments.
	scommit = "!f(){ d=${1%%!*}; a=${1##*!}; arg=\"--until=$d -1\"; if [ $a != $1 ]; then arg=\"$arg --committer=$a\"; fi; shift; git rev-list $arg ${1:+\"$@\"}; }; f"

	# git scommits <stamp> <rev-list-args> - as above, but list all matching commits.
	scommits = "!f(){ d=${1%%!*}; a=${1##*!}; arg=\"--until=$d --after $d\"; if [ $a != $1 ]; then arg=\"$arg --committer=$a\"; fi; shift; git rev-list $arg ${1:+\"$@\"}; }; f"

	# git smaster <stamp> - list most recent commit on master that matches <stamp>.
	smaster = "!f(){ git scommit \"$1\" master --first-parent; }; f"
	smasters = "!f(){ git scommits \"$1\" master --first-parent; }; f"

	# git shs <stamp> - show the commits on master that match <stamp>.
	shs = "!f(){ stamp=$(git smasters $1); shift; git show ${stamp:?not found} $*; }; f"

	# git slog <stamp> <log-args> - start git log at <stamp> on master
	slog = "!f(){ stamp=$(git smaster $1); shift; git log ${stamp:?not found} $*; }; f"

	# git sco <stamp> - check out most recent commit on master that matches <stamp>.
	sco = "!f(){ stamp=$(git smaster $1); shift; git checkout ${stamp:?not found} $*; }; f"
--------

There is a rare case in which an action stamp will not refer uniquely
to one commit. It is theoretically possible that the same author might
check in revisions on different branches within the one-second
resolution of the timestamps in a fast-import stream.  There is
nothing to be done about this; tools using action stamps need to be
aware of the possibility and throw a warning when it occurs.

In order to support reference lifting, reposurgeon internally builds a
legacy-reference map that associates revision identifiers in older
version-control systems with commits.  The contents of this map comes
from three places: (1) cvs2svn:rev properties if the repository was
read from a Subversion dump stream, (2) $Id$ and $Revision$ headers in
repository files, and (3) the _.git/cvs-revisions_
created by +git cvsimport+.

The detailed sequence for lifting possible references is this: first,
find possible CVS and Subversion references with the +references+ or
=N visibility set; then replace them with equivalent cookies; then run
+references lift+ to turn the cookies into action stamps (using the
information in the legacy-reference map) without having to do the
lookup by hand.

+references+ [ +list+ | +edit+ | +lift+ ] [>__outfile__ ]::
   With the modifier 'list', list commit and tag comments for strings
   that might be CVS- or Subversion-style revision identifiers. This will
   be useful when you want to replace them with equivalent cookies that
   can automatically be translated into VCS-independent action
   stamps. This reporting command supports >-redirection.
   It is equivalent to '=N list'.
+
With the modifier 'edit', edit the set where revision IDs are
found.  This version of the command supports < and > redirection.
This is equivalent to '=N edit'.
+
With the modifier "lift", attempt to resolve Subversion and CVS
cookies in comments into action stamps using the legacy map. An action
stamp is a timestamp/email/sequence-number combination uniquely
identifying the commit associated with that blob, as described in
<xref linkend='style'/>.
+
It is not guaranteed that every such reference will be resolved,
or even that any at all will be. Normally all references in history
from a Subversion repository will resolve, but CVS references are less
likely to be resolvable.


[[changelogs]]
=== CHANGELOGS ===

CVS and Subversion do not have separated notions of committer
and author for changesets; when lifted to a VCS that does, like git,
their one author field is used for both.

However, if the project used the FSF ChangeLog convention,
many changesets will include a ChangeLog modification  listing an
author for the commit. In the common case that the changeset was
derived from a patch and committed by a project maintainer,
but the ChangeLog entry names the actual author, this information
can be recovered.

Use the "changelogs" command/  This takes neither arguments nor
a selection set. It mines the ChangeLog files for authorship data. 

It assumes such files have the basename 'ChangeLog',
and that they are in the format used by FSF projects: entry header
lines begin with YYYY-MM-DD and are followed by a fullname/address.
When a ChangeLog file modification is found in a clique, the entry
header at or before the section changed since its last revision is
parsed and the address is inserted as the commit author.

If the entry header contains an email address but no name, a name
will be filled in if possible by looking for the address in author
map entries.

In accordance with FSF policy for ChangeLogs, any date in an
attribution header is discarded and the committer date is used.
However, if the name is an author-map alias with an associated timezone,
that zone is used.

The command reports statistics on how many commits were altered.

[[tarballs]]
=== RELEASE TARBALLS ===

When converting a legacy repository, it sometimes happens that
there are archived releases of the project surviving from before the
date of the repository's  initial commit.  It may be desirable to
insert those releases at the front of the repository history.

To do this, use the "incorporate" command.  This command takes
as its single argument naming a tarball, the content of which is to be
inserted as a commit. It may be a gzipped or bzipped tarball. The
initial segment of each path is assumed to be a version directory and
stripped off. The number of segments stripped off can be set with the
option --strip=n, n defaulting to 1.

Takes a singleton selection set.  Normally inserts before that commit; with
the option --after, insert after it. The default selection set is the very
first commit of the repository.

The option --date can be used to set the commit date. It takes an argument,
which is expected to be an RFC3339 timestamp.

The generated commit has a committer field (the invoking user)
and gets as its commit date the modification time of the
newest file in the tarball (not the mod time of the tarball
itself). No author field is generated.  A comment recording the
tarball name is generated.

Note that the import stream generated by this command is - while
correct - not optimal, and may in particular contain duplicate
blobs.

[[macros]]
=== VARIABLES AND MACROS ===

Occasionally you will need to issue a large number of complex surgical
commands of very similar form, and it's convenient to be able to
package that form so you don't need to do a lot of error-prone typing.
For those occasions, reposurgeon supports simple
forms of named variables and macro expansion.

+assign+ [ _name_ ]::
   Compute a leading selection set and assign it to a symbolic name.
   It is an error to assign to a name that is already assigned, or to
   any existing branch name.  Assignments may be cleared by sequence
   mutations (though not ordinary deletions); you will see a warning
   when this occurs.
+
With no selection set and no name, list all assignments.>
+
If the option --singleton is given, the assignment will throw an error
if the selection set is not a singleton.
+
Use this to optimize out location and selection computations
that would otherwise be performed repeatedly, e.g. in macro calls.

+unassign+ _name_::
    Unassign a symbolic name.  Throws an error if the name is not
    assigned.


+names+ [>__outfile__ ]::
   List the names of all known branches and tags.  Tells
   you what things are legal within angle brackets and
   parentheses.
   
+define+ _name_ _body_::
   Define a macro.  The first whitespace-separated token is the
   name; the remainder of the line is the body, unless it is
   "{", which begins a multi-line macro terminated by
   a line beginning with "}".
+
A later "do" call can invoke this macro.
+
The command "define" by itself without a name or
body produces a macro list.

+do+ _name_ _arguments_...::
   Expand and perform a macro.  The first whitespace-separated
   token is the name of the macro to be called; remaining tokens replace
   {0}, {1}... in the macro definition. Tokens may contain whitespace if
   they are string-quoted; string quotes are stripped. Macros can call
   macros.
+
If the macro expansion does not itself begin with a selection set,
whatever set was specified before the "do" keyword is available to
the command generated by the expansion.

+undefine+ _name_::
   Undefine the named macro.
+
Here's an example to illustrate how you might use this.  In CVS
repositories of projects that use the GNU ChangeLog convention, a very
common pre-conversion artifact is a commit with the comment "*** empty
log message ***" that modifies only a ChangeLog entry explaining the
commit immediately previous to it. The following
+
--------
define changelog <{0}> &amp; /empty log message/ squash --pushback
do changelog 2012-08-14T21:51:35Z
do changelog 2012-08-08T22:52:14Z
do changelog 2012-08-07T04:48:26Z
do changelog 2012-08-08T07:19:09Z
do changelog 2012-07-28T18:40:10Z
--------
+
is equivalent to the more verbose
+
--------
<2012-08-14T21:51:35Z> &amp; /empty log message/ squash --pushback
<2012-08-08T22:52:14Z> &amp; /empty log message/ squash --pushback
<2012-08-07T04:48:26Z> &amp; /empty log message/ squash --pushback
<2012-08-08T07:19:09Z> &amp; /empty log message/ squash --pushback
<2012-07-28T18:40:10Z> &amp; /empty log message/ squash --pushback
--------
+
but you are less likely to make difficult-to-notice errors typing the
first version.
+
(Also note how the text regexp acts as a failsafe against the
possibility of typing a wrong date that doesn't refer to a commit with
an empty comment. This was a real-world example from the CVS-to-git
conversion of groff.)

+script+ _filename_ [ _arg_... ]::
   Takes a filename and optional following arguments.
   Reads each line from the file and executes it as a command.
+
During execution of the script, the script name replaces the
string $0 and the optional following arguments (if any) replace the
strings $1, $2 ... $n in the script text. This is done before
tokenization, so the $1 in a string like "foo$1bar" will
be expanded.  Additionally, $$ is expanded to the current process ID
(which may be useful for scripts that use tempfiles).
+
Within scripts (and only within scripts) reposurgeon
accepts a slightly extended syntax: First, a backslash ending a line signals
that the command continues on the next line. Any number of consecutive lines
thus escaped are concatenated, without the ending backslashes, prior to
evaluation. Second, a command that takes an input filename argument can instead
take literal following data in the syntax of a shell here-document. That is: if
the filename is replaced by "<<EOF", all following lines in the script up
to a terminating line consisting only of "EOF" will be read, placed in a
temporary file, and that file fed to the command and afterwards deleted. EOF
may be replaced by any string. Backslashes have no special meaning while
reading a here-document.
+
Scripts may have comments.  Any line beginning with a pound sign is
ignored. If a line has a trailing position that begins with one or more
whitespace characters followed by '#', that trailing portion is
ignored.

[[artifact-removal]]
=== ARTIFACT REMOVAL ===

Some commands automate fixing various kinds of artifacts
associated with repository conversions from older systems.

+authors+ [ +read+ | +write+ ] [<__filename__] [>__filename+_]::
   Apply or dump author-map information for the specified selection
   set, defaulting to all events.
+
Lifts from CVS and Subversion may have only usernames local to
the repository host in committer and author IDs. DVCSes want email
addresses (net-wide identifiers) and complete names. To supply the map
from one to the other, an authors file is expected to consist of
lines each beginning with a local user ID, followed by a '=' (possibly
surrounded by whitespace) followed by a full name and email address,
optionally followed by a timezone offset field.  Thus:
+
--------
ferd = Ferd J. Foonly <foonly@foo.com> America/New_York
--------
+
An authors file may also contain lines of this form
+
--------
+ Ferd J. Foonly <foonly@foobar.com> America/Los_Angeles
--------
+
These are interpreted as aliases for the last preceding '='
entry that may appear in ChangeLog files. When such an alias is
matched on a ChangeLog attribution line, the author attribution
for the commit is mapped to the basename, but the timezone is used
as is.  This accommodates people with past addresses (possibly at)
different locations) unifying such aliases in metadata so searches
and statistical aggregation will work better.
+
An authors file may have comment lines beginning with '#'; these
are ignored.
+
When an authors file is applied, email addresses in committer and author
metadata for which the local ID matches between < and @ are replaced
according to the mapping (this handles git-svn lifts). Alternatively,
if the local ID is the entire address, this is also considered a match
(this handles what git-cvsimport and cvs2git do). If a timezone was
specified in the map entry, that person's author and committer dates
are mapped to it.
+
With the 'read' modifier, or no modifier, apply author mapping
data (from standard input or a <-redirected file).  May be useful
if you are editing a repo or dump created by
+cvs2git+ or by +git-svn+ invoked
without -A.
+
With the 'write' modifier, write a mapping file that could be
interpreted by +authors read+, with entries for each
unique committer, author, and tagger (to standard output or a
<-redirected mapping file). This may be helpful as a start on
building an authors file, though each part to the right of an equals
sign will need editing.

+branchify+ [ _path-set_ ]::
   Specify the list of directories to be treated as potential
   branches (to become tags if there are no modifications after the
   creation copies) when analyzing a Subversion repo. This list is
   ignored when the --nobranch read option is used.  It
   defaults to the 'standard layout' set of directories, plus any
   unrecognized directories in the repository root.
+
With no arguments, displays the current branchification set.
+
An asterisk at the end of a path in the set means 'all immediate
subdirectories of this path, unless they are part of another (longer)
path in the branchify set'.
+
Note that the branchify set is a property of the reposurgeon
interpreter, not of any individual repository, and will persist across
Subversion dumpfile reads. This may lead to unexpected results if you
forget to re-set it.

+branchify_map+ [ _/regex/branch/_... ] ::
   Specify the list of regular expressions used for mapping the svn
   branches that are detected by branchify. If none of the expressions
   match the default behaviour applies. This maps a branch to the name
   of the last directory, except for trunk and "*" which are
   mapped to master and root.
+
With no arguments the current regex replacement pairs are
shown. Passing 'reset' will clear the mapping.
+
The branchify command will match each branch name against regex1
and if it matches rewrite its branch name to branch1. If not it will
try regex2 and so forth until it either found a matching regex or
there are no regexs left. The branch name can use Go
backreferences.
+
Note that the regular expressions are appended to 'refs/'
without either the needed 'heads/' or 'tags/'. This allows for
choosing the right kind of branch type.
+
While the syntax template above uses slashes, any first character will
be used as a delimiter (and you will need to use a different one in the
common case that the paths contain slashes).
+
You must give this command _before_ the
Subversion repository read it is supposed to affect!
+
Note that the branchify_map set is a property of the reposurgeon
interpreter, not of any individual repository, and will persist across
Subversion dumpfiile or repository reads. This may lead to unexpected
results if you forget to re-set it.

[[examining-tree-states]]
=== EXAMINING TREE STATES ===

+manifest+ [ _regular expression_ ] [>__outfile__ ]::
   Takes an optional selection set argument defaulting to all commits, and
   an optional regular expression. For each commit in the selection set,
   print the mapping of all paths in that commit tree to the corresponding blob
   marks, mirroring what files would be created in a checkout of the commit. If a
   regular expression is given, only print "path -> mark" lines for paths matching
   it. This command supports > redirection.

+checkout+ _directory_::
   Takes a selection set which must resolve to a single commit, and
   a second argument. The second argument is interpreted as a directory
   name.  The state of the code tree at that commit is materialized beneath
   the directory.

+diff+ [>__outfile__ ]::
   Display the difference between commits. Takes a selection-set
   argument which must resolve to exactly two commits. Supports output
   redirection.

[[housekeeping]]
=== HOUSEKEEPING ===

These are backed up by the following housekeeping commands, none of
which take a selection set:

+help+::
   Get help on the interpreter commands. Optionally follow with
   whitespace and a command name; with no argument, lists all commands. '?'
   also invokes this.

+shell+::
   Execute the shell command given in the remainder of the line.
   '!' also invokes this.

+prefer+ [ _repotype_ ]::
   With no arguments, describe capabilities of all supported
   systems. With an argument (which must be the name of a supported
   system) this has two effects:
+
First, if there are multiple repositories in a
directory you do a read on, reposurgeon will read the preferred one
(otherwise it will complain that it can't choose among them).
+
Secondly, this will change reposurgeon's preferred type for output.
This means that you do a write to a directory, it will build a repo of
the preferred type rather than its original type (if it had one).
+
If no preferred type has been explicitly selected, reading in a
repository (but not a fast-import stream) will implicitly set the
preferred type to the type of that repository.
+
In older versions of reposurgeon this
command changed the type of the selected repository, if there is one.
That behavior interacted badly with attempts to interpret legacy IDs
and has been removed.

+sourcetype+ [ _repotype_ ]::
   Report (with no arguments) or select (with one argument) the current
   repository's source type.  This type is normally set at
   repository-read time, but may remain unset if the source was a stream
   file.
+
The source type affects the interpretation of legacy IDs (for
purposes of the =N visibility set and the 'references' command) by
controlling the regular expressions used to recognize them. If no
preferred output type has been set, it may also change the output
format of stream files made from the repository.
+
The source type is reliably set whenever a live repository is read, or
when a Subversion stream or Fossil dump is interpreted but not
necessarily by other stream files. Streams generated by
cvs-fast-export(1) using the --reposurgeon are detected as CVS. In
some other cases, the source system is detected from the presence of
magic $-headers in contents blobs.

[[instrumentation]]
=== INSTRUMENTATION ===

A few commands have been implemented primarily for debugging and
regression-testing purposes, but may be useful in unusual
circumstances.

The output of most of these commands can individually be redirected to
a named output file. Where indicated in the syntax, you can prefix the
output filename with ">" and give it as a following
argument.

+index+ [>__outfile__ ]::
   Display four columns of info on objects in the selection set:
   their number, their type, the associate mark (or '-' if no mark) and a
   summary field varying by type.  For a branch or tag it's the
   reference; for a commit it's the commit branch; for a blob it's the
   repository path of the file in the blob.
+
The default selection set for this command is =CTRU, all objects
except blobs.

+resolve+ [_label-text..._]::
   Does nothing but resolve a selection-set expression
   and echo the resulting event-number set to standard
   output. The remainder of the line after the command is used
   as a label for the output.
+
Implemented mainly for regression testing, but may be useful
for exploring the selection-set language.

_selection_ +resolve+ [>__outfile__ ] [ _label-text..._ ]::
   Does nothing but resolve an attribution selection-set expression for
   the selected events and echo the resulting attribution-number set to
   standard output. The remainder of the line after the command is used
   as a label for the output.
+
Implemented mainly for regression testing, but may be useful
for exploring the selection-set language.

+verbose+ [ _logclasses..._ ]::
   Without an argument, list log message classes.
   With an argument, enable logging of specified message classses (0
   for none). Normally the message types "shout" and "warn" are
   enabled. You can get a list of other log message types from "help
   verbose".

+logfile path+ [ _n_ ]::
   Error, warning, and diagnostic messages are normall emitted to standard
   error.  This commandm with a nonempty path argument, directs them to 
   the specified file instead.

+print+ _output-text..._::
   Does nothing but ship its argument line to standard
   output. Useful in regression tests.

+version+ [_version_...]::
   With no argument, display the program version and the list of
   VCSes directly supported.  With argument, declare the major version
   (single digit) or full version (major.minor) under which the enclosing
   script was developed.  The program will error out if the major version
   has changed (which means the surgical language is not backwards
   compatible).
+
It is good practice to start your lift script with a version
requirement, especially if you are going to archive it for later
reference.

+prompt+ [ _format..._ ]::
   Set the command prompt format to the value of the command line; with
   an empty command line, display it. The prompt format is evaluated in
   after each command with the following dictionary substitutions:
   +
*chosen:* The name of the selected repository, or None if none is currently
selected.
+  
Thus, one useful format might be 'rs[%(chosen)s]%% '.
+
More format items may be added in the future.  The default
prompt corresponds to the format 'reposurgeon%% '. The format line is
evaluated with shell quotng of tokens, so that spaces can be
included.

+history+::
   List the commands you have entered this session.

+legacy+ [ +read+ | +write+ ] [__<filename__] [__>filename__]::
   Apply or list legacy-reference information. Does not take a
   selection set. The 'read' variant reads from standard input or a
   <-redirected filename; the 'write' variant writes to standard
   output or a >-redirected filename.
+
A legacy-reference file maps reference cookies to (committer,
commit-date, sequence-number) pairs; these in turn (should) uniquely
identify a commit.  The format is two whitespace-separated fields:
the cookie followed by an action stamp identifying the commit.
+
It should not normally be necessary to use this command.  The
legacy map is automatically preserved through repository reads and
rebuilds, being stored in the file _legacy-map_ under
the repository subdirectory..

+set+ [ _option_ ]::
   Turn on an option flag.  With no arguments, list all options
+
Most options are described in conjunction with the specific
operations that the modify. One of general interest is
"compressblobs"; this enables compression on the blob
files in the internal representation reposurgeon uses for editing
repositories. With this option, reading and writing of repositories is
slower, but editing a repository requires less (sometimes much less)
disk space.

+clear+ [ _option_ ]::
   Turn off an option flag.  With no arguments, list all options

+timing+ [>__outfile__ ]::
   Display statistics on phase timing in repository analysis.
   Mainly of interest to developers trying to speed up the program.
+
If the command has following text, this creates a new, named time mark
that will be visible in a later report; this may be useful during 
long-running conversion recipes.

+readlimit+ [number]::
   Set a maximum number of commits to read from a stream.  If the limit
   is reached before EOF it will be logged. Mainly useful for
   benchmarking. Without arguments, report the read limit; 0 means
   there is none.

+memory+::
   Report memory usage.  Runs a garbage-collect before reporting so the figure will better relect
   storage currently held in loaded repositories; this will not affect the reported high-water
   mark.

+profile+ [ +live+ | +start+ | +save+ ] [ _args..._ ]::
    Profiling is enabled by default, but viewing the profile data
    requires either starting the http server with "profile live", or
    saving it to a file with "profile save". When no arguments are
    given it prints out the available types of profiles.

+exit+::
   Exit, reporting the time. Included here because, while EOT will
   also cleanly exit the interpreter, this command reports elapsed time
   since start.

[[mercurial]]
== WORKING WITH MERCURIAL ==
There is a built-in extractor class to perform extractions from
Mercurial repositories.

Mercurial branches are exported as branches in the exported
repository and tags are exported as tags. By default, bookmarks are
ignored. You can specify explicit handling for bookmarks by setting
<parameter>reposurgeon.bookmarks</parameter> in your
<filename>.hg/hgrc_. Set the value to the prefix that
reposurgeon should use for
bookmarks.

For example, if your bookmarks represent branches, put this at
the bottom of your <filename>.hg/hgrc_:

--------
[reposurgeon]
bookmarks=heads/
--------

If you do that, it's your responsibility to ensure that branch
names do not conflict with bookmark names. You can add a prefix like
<computeroutput>bookmarks=heads/feature-</computeroutput> to
disambiguate as necessary.

[[subversion]]
== WORKING WITH SUBVERSION ==

reposurgeon can read Subversion
dumpfiles. You must point it at a repository, not a checkout directory.

The transaction model of Subversion is nothing like that of the 
DVCSes (distributed version control systems) that followed it. Two of the more
obvious differences are around tags and branches.

A Subversion tag isn't an annotation attached to a commit. The
Subversion data model is that a history is a sequence of surgical
operations on a tree; there are no annotation tags as such, a tag is
just another branch of the tree.  Accordingly a Subversion tag, a copy
of the state of an entire branch at a particular revision. This can be
losslessly translated to an annotation only if no additional commits
are added to the tag branch after the copy. But nothing prevents this!
reposurgeon tries to do the right thing,
creating a DVCS-style tag when it can and otherwise preserving the
branch.

There is a subtler problem around branches themselves. In a
DVCS, deleting a branch removes it fronm the repository history
entirely, a fact of some significance since repositories are copied
around often enough that keeping every discared experiment forever
would eventually drown the live content in superannuated cruft.
Subversion repositories, on the other hand, are designed on the
assumption that they sit on one server and never move.  A Subversion
branch is just a directory in the branch namespace; if you delete it,
you won't see it in following revisions but if you update to an older
one that content will still be there.

By default, reposurgeon treats branch
deletions in a DVCS-like way, removing the history of the branch.  This
means that it will _not_ be live in translated revisions
from prior to the commit time of the deletion.  However a --preserve
option is available that prevents the removal of dead branches.

Bad things can happen when a tag directory is created, copied
from, deleted, then recreated from a different source directory. This
is a place where the Subversion model of tags clashes badly with the
changeset-DAG model used by git and oter DVCSes. Especially if the
same tag is recreated later!  The obvious thing to do when convetubg
this sequence would be to just nuke the tag history from from the
deletion back to its branch point, but that will cause problens if a
copy operation was ever sourced in the deleted (branch and this does
happen!).

We deal with this by renaming the deleted branch and patching
any copy operations from it later in the history. This gandles
many tag-delete-copy cases, but not all.  Some particularly perverse
cases will convert incorrectly and require hand intervention.

=== READING SUBVERSION REPOSITORIES ===

Certain optional modifiers on the read command change
its behavior when reading Subversion repositories:

--nobranch::
Suppress branch analysis.

--preserve::
Never discard metadata.  In particular, preserve
branch-creation commits (and their metadata) in full rather than turning
commits for empty branches into bare gitspace resets.  Also, preserve
branches and tags with following tip deletes rather than nuking them;
the tip deletes become tags.

--ignore-properties::
Suppress read-time warnings about discarded property
settings.

--user-ignores::
Don't generate .gitignore files from svn:ignore
properties.  Instead, just pass through .gitignore files found in the
history.

--use-uuid::
If the --use-uuid read option is set, the repository's
UUID will be used as the hostname when faking up email addresses, a la
git-svn.  Otherwise, addresses will be generated the way git cvs-import does
it, simply copying the username into the address field.

--noignores::
Do not fill in an equivalent of default Subversion ignore patterns.

These modifiers can go anywhere in any order on the read command
line after the read verb. They must be whitespace-separated.

It is also possible to embed a magic comment in a Subversion
stream file to set these options. Prefix a space-separated list of
them with the magic comment " # reposurgeon-read-options:"; the
leading space is required. This may be useful when synthesizing test
loads; in partticular, a stream file that does not set up a standard
trunk/branches/tags directoryt layout can use this to perform a
mapping of all commits onto the master branch that the git importer
will accept.

Here are the rules used for mapping subdirectories in a
Subversion repository to branches:

* At any given time there is a set of eligible
paths and path wildcards which declare potential branches.
See the documentation of the +branchify+
for how to alter this set, which initially consists of
{trunk, tags/*, branches/*, and '*'}.

* A repository is considered "flat" if it has no
directory that matches a path or path wildcard in the branchify set.
All commits in a flat repository are assigned to branch master, and
what would have been branch structure becomes directory structure.  In
this case, we're done; all the other rules apply to non-flat
repos.

* If you give the option --nobranch when reading a Subversion
repository, branch analysis is skipped and the repository is treated
as though flat (left as a linear sequence of commits on
refs/heads/master).  This may be useful if your repository
configuration is highly unusual and you need to do your own branch
surgery. Note that this option will disable partitioning of mixed
commits.

* If "trunk" is eligible, it always becomes the master
branch.

* If an element of the branchify set ends with *, each
immediate subdirectory of it is considered a potential branch.  If '*'
is in the branchify set (which is true by default) all top-level
directories other than /trunk, /tags, and /branches are also
considered potential branches.

* Files in the top-level directory are assigned to a
synthetic branch named 'root'.

* Each potential branch is checked to see if it has
commits on it after the initial creation or copy.  If there are such
commits, it becomes a branch.  If not, it may become a tag in order to
preserve the commit metadata (see the description of the --preserve
option below).  In all cases, the name of any created tag or branch is
the basename of the directory.

Branch-creation operations with no following commits are treated
differently depending on whether or not the --preserve option is
on. If it is off (the default) the branch creation becomes an empty
gitspace branch represented by a reset operation; any comment on the
commit is issued with a warning.  If --preserve is on, the comment
metadata is preserved in an empty commit attached to the branchpoint.

Otherwise, each commit that only creates or deletes directories
(in particular, copy commits for tags and branches, and commits that
only change properties) will be transformed into a tag named after the
tag or branch, containing the date/author/comment metadata from the
commit.

Subversion branch deletions are turned into deletealls, clearing the
fileset of the import-stream branch.  When a branch
finishes with a deleteall at its tip, the deleteall is transformed
into a tag. This rule cleans up after aborted branch renames.

Occasionally (and usually by mistake) a branchy Subversion
repository will contain revisions that touch multiple branches. These
are handled by partitioning them into multiple import-stream commits,
one on each affected branch. The Legacy-ID of such a split commit
will have a pseudo-decimal part - for example, if Subversion revision 2317
touches three branches, the three generated commits will have IDs
2317.1, 2317.2, and 2317.3.

The svn:executable and svn:special properties are translated
into permission settings in the input stream; svn:executable becomes
100755 and svn:special becomes 120000 (indicating a symlink; the blob
contents will be the path to which the symlink should resolve).

Any cvs2svn:rev properties generated by
cvs2svn are incorporated into the internal map
used for reference-lifting, then discarded.

Normally, per-directory svn:ignore properties become .gitignore files.
Actual .gitignore files in a Subversion directory are presumed to have
been created by git-svn users separately from native Subversion ignore
properties and discarded with a warning. It is up to the user to merge
the content of such files into the target repository by hand.  But
this behavior is inverted by the --user-ignores option; if that is on,
.gitignore files are passed through and Subversion svn:ignore
properties are discarded.

(Regardless of the setting of the --user-ignores option,
.cvsignore files found in Subversion repositories always become
.gitignores in the translation.  The assumption is that these date
from before a CVS-to-SVN lift and should be preserved to affect
behavior when browsing that section of the repository.)

svn:mergeinfo properties are interpreted.  Any svn:mergeinfo property
on a revision A with a merge source range ending in revision B produces
a merge link such that B becomes a parent of A.

All other Subversion properties are discarded. (This may change in a
future release.) The property for which this is most likely to cause
semantic problems is svn:eol-style. However, since property-change-only
commits get turned into annotated tags, the translated tags will retain
information about setting changes.

The sub-second resolution on Subversion commit dates is discarded;
Git wants integer timestamps only.

Because fast-import format cannot represent an empty directory,
empty directories in Subversion repositories will be lost in
translation.

Normally, Subversion local usernames are mapped in the style of
git cvs-import; thus user "foo" becomes "foo <foo>", which is
sufficient to pacify git and other systems that require email
addresses.  With the option "svn_use_uuid", usernames are mapped in the
git-svn style, with the repository's UUID used as a fake domain in the
email address. Both forms can be remapped to real address using
the +authors read+ command.

Reading a Subversion stream enables writing of the legacy map as
'legacy' passthroughs when the repo is written to a stream
file.

reposurgeon tries hard to silently do the
right thing, but there are Subversion edge cases in which it emits warnings
because a human may need to intervene and perform fixups by hand. Here
are the less obvious messages it may emit:

user-generated .gitignore::
   This message means means reposurgeon has
   found a <filename>.gitignore_ file in the Subversion
   repository it is analyzing. This probably happened because somebody
   was using +git-svn+ as a live gateway, and created
   ignores which may or may not be congruent with those in the generated
   <filename>.gitignore_ files that the Subversion ignore
   properties will be translated into.  You'll need to make a policy
   decision about which set of ignores to use in the conversion, and
   possibly set the --user-ignores option on read to pass through
   user-created <filename>.gitignore_ files; in that case this
   warning will not be emitted.

permission information may be lost::
   A Subversion node change on a file sets or clears properties,
   but no ancestor can be found for this file. Executable or symlink
   position may be set wrongly on later revisions of this
   file. Subversion user-defined properties may also be scrambled or
   lost. Usually this error can be ignored.

properties set::
   reposurgeon has detected a setting of a
   user-defined property, or the Subversion properties
   svn:externals. These properties cannot be expressed in an import
   stream; the user is notified in case this is a showstopper for the
   conversion or some corrective action is required, but normally this
   error can be ignored.  This warning is suppressed by the
   --ignore-properties option.

branch links detected by file ops only::
   Branch links are normally deduced by examining Subversion directory
   copy operations. A common user error (making a branch with a non-Subversion
   directory copy and then doing an svn add on the contends) can defeat this.
   While reposurgeon should detect and cope with most such
   copies correctly, you should examine the commit graph to check that the
   branch is rooted at the correct place.

could not tagify root commit::
   The earliest commit in your Subversion repository has file operations,
   rather than being a pure directory creation. This probably means your
   Subversion dump file is malformed, or you may have attempted to lift
   from an incremental dump. Proceed with caution.

deleting parentless tip delete::
   This message may be triggered by a Subversion branch move followed by
   a re-creation under the source name. Check near the indicated revision to make
   sure the renamed branch is connected to master.

lookback for XXX failed, not making branch link::
   Branch analysis failed, probably due to a set of file copies that
   reposurgeon thought it should interpret as a botched
   branch creation but couldn't deduce a history for.  This is a warning;
   check how the directory XXX is converted, it may need post-editing
   into a branch.

=== MID-BRANCH DELETIONS ===

When a branch A is deleted and a branch B is copied to the name A, the
Subversion intent is to replace the contents of branch A with the
contents of branch B, keeping the A name.  This is a poor man's merge
from before "svn merge" existed. Many Subversion users who formed
their habits before svn merge existed still operate this way.

In git terms, this almost corresponds to a merge of A into B
followed by a rename of B to A.  Branch B continues to exist, however,
so we can't do that in translation.  The
reposurgeon logic does not try to be clever about this,
because "clever would have rebarbative edge cases; the sequence is
translated into a deleteall followed by a commit operation that
recreates the B files under corresponding A names. No merge link is
created.

This case is mentioned here because it is likely to confuse
the merge-tracking algorithms used, e.g., by git diff.

[[ignore]]
== IGNORE PATTERNS ==

reposurgeon recognizes how supported VCSes represent file ignores (CVS
.cvsignore files lurking untranslated in older Subversion
repositories, Subversion ignore properties,
.gitignore/.hgignore/.bzrignore file in other systems) and moves
ignore declarations among these containers on repo input and
output. This will be sufficient if the ignore patterns are exact
filenames.

Translation may not, however, be perfect when the ignore patterns are
Unix glob patterns or regular expressions.  This compatibility table
describes which patterns will translate; "plain" indicates a plain
filename with no glob or regexp syntax or negation, "no !" means no
negated regexps, and "no RE:" means the RE orefix for a regular
expression does not work.

RCS has no ignore files or patterns and is therefore not
included in the table.

|==============================================================================================================

The hg rows and columns of the table describes compatibility to
hg's glob syntax rather than its default regular-expression syntax.
When writing to an hg repository from any other kind,
reposurgeon prepends to the output .hgignore a
"syntax: glob" line.

[[style]]
== TRANSLATION STYLE ==

After converting a CVS, SVN, or BitKeeper repository, check for and remove
$-cookies in the head revision(s) of the files. The full Subversion
set is $Date:, $Revision:, $Author:, $HeadURL and $Id:. CVS uses
$Author:, $Date:, $Header:, $Id:, $Log:, $Revision:, also (rarely)
$Locker:, $Name:, $RCSfile:, $Source:, and $State:.

When you need to specify a commit, use the action-stamp format
that +references lift+ generates when it can resolve
an SVN or CVS reference in a comment. It is best that you
_not vary from this format_, even in trivial ways
like omitting the 'Z' or changing the 'T' or '!' or ':'. Making action
stamps uniform and machine-parseable will have good consequences for
future repository-browsing tools.

Sometimes, in converting a repository, you may need to insert an
explanatory comment - for example, if metadata has been garbled or
missing and you need to point to that fact. It's helpful for
repository-browsing tools if there is a uniform syntax for this that
is highly unlikely to show up in repository comments.  We recommend
enclosing translation notes in [[ ]].  This has the advantage of being
visually similar to the [ ] traditionally used for editorial comments
in text.

It is good practice to include, in the comment for the root
commit of the repository, a note dating and attributing the conversion
work and explaining these conventions.  Example:

--------
[[This repository was converted from Subversion to git on 2011-10-24
by Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>.  Here and elsewhere, conversion
notes are enclosed in double square brackets. Junk commits generated
by cvs2svn have been removed, commit references have been mapped into
a uniform VCS-independent syntax, and some comments edited into
summary-plus-continuation form.]]
--------

It is also good practice to include a generated tag at the
point of conversion. E.g

--------
msgin --create <<EOF
Tag-Name: git-conversion

Marks the spot at which this repository was converted from Subversion to git.
EOF
--------


[[advanced]]
== ADVANCED EXAMPLES ==

--------
define lastchange {
@max(=B &amp; [/ChangeLog/] &amp; /{0}/B)? list
}
--------

List the last commit that refers to a ChangeLog file containing
a specified string. (The trick here is that ? extends the singleton
set consisting of the last eligible ChangeLog blob to its set of
referring commits, and +list+only notices the
commits.)

[[extensions]]
== STREAM SYNTAX EXTENSIONS ==

The event-stream parser in "reposurgeon" supports some extended
syntax. Exporters designed to work with "reposurgeon" may have a
--reposurgeon option that enables emission of extended syntax;
notably, this is true of cvs-fast-export(1).  The remainder of this
section describes these syntax extensions.  The properties they set
are (usually) preserved and re-output when the stream file is written.

The token "#reposurgeon" at the start of a comment line in a
fast-import stream signals reposurgeon that the remainder is an
extension command to be interpreted by "reposurgeon".

One such extension command is implemented: +#sourcetype+, which
behaves identically to the reposurgeon +sourcetype+ command. An
exporter for a version-control system named "frobozz" could, for
example, say

--------
#reposurgeon sourcetype frobozz
--------

Within a commit, a magic comment of the form "#legacy-id" declares a
legacy ID from the stream file's source version-control system.

Also accepted is the bzr syntax for setting per-commit
properties. While parsing commit syntax, a line beginning with the
token "property" must continue with a whitespace-separated
property-name token. If it is then followed by a newline it is taken
to set that boolean-valued property to true. Otherwise it must be
followed by a numeric token specifying a data length, a space,
following data (which may contain newlines) and a terminating
newline. For example:

--------
commit refs/heads/master
mark :1
committer Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com> 1289147634 -0500
data 16
Example commit.

property legacy-id 2 r1
M 644 inline README
--------

Unlike other extensions, bzr properties are only preserved on
stream output if the preferred type is bzr, because any importer other
than bzr's will choke on them.

[[changes]]
== INCOMPATIBLE LANGUAGE CHANGES ==

In versions before 3.23, "prefer" changed the
repository type as well as the preferred output format.

In versions before 3.0, the general command syntax put the
command verb first, then the selection set (if any) then modifiers
(VSO).  It has changed to optional selection set first, then command
verb, then modifiers (SVO). The change made parsing simpler, allowed
abolishing some noise keywords, and recapitulates a successful design
pattern in some other Unix tools - notably
sed(1).

In versions before 3.0, path expressions only matched
commits, not commits and the associated blobs as well. The names
of the "a" and "c" flags were different.

In reposurgeon versions before 3.0, the delete command had the
semantics of squash; also, the policy flags did not require a "--"
prefix. The "--delete" flag was named "obliterate".

In reposurgeon versions before 3.0, read and
write optionally took file arguments rather than requiring redirects
(and the write command never wrote into directories). This was changed
in order to allow these commands to have modifiers. These modifiers
replaced several global options that no longer exist.

In reposurgeon versions before 3.0, the earliest factor in a unite
command always kept its tag and branch names unaltered. The new rule
for resolving name conflicts, giving priority to the latest factor,
produces more natural behavior when uniting two repositories end to
end; the master branch of the second (later) one keeps its name.

In reposurgeon versions before 3.0, the tagify
command expected policies as trailing arguments to alter its behaviour. The new
syntax uses similarly named options with leading dashes, that can appear
anywhere after the tagify command

In versions before 2.9. the syntax of "authors", "legacy", "list", and
what are now "msg{in|out}" was different (and "legacy" was
"fossils"). They took plain filename arguments rather that using
redirect < and >.

In versions before 4.0, msgin and msgout were named "mailbox_in"
and "mailbox_out:"; branchify was "branchify_map". Previous
versions used the Python variant of regular expressions; some of
the more idiosyncratic features of these are not replicated in the
Go implementation..

[[limitations]]
== LIMITATIONS AND GUARANTEES ==

Guarantee: In DVCses that use commit hashes, editing with reposurgeon
never changes the hash of a commit object unless (a) you edit the
commit, or (b) it is a descendant of an edited commit in a VCS that
includes parent hashes in the input of a child object's hash (git and
hg both do this).

Guarantee: reposurgeon only requires main memory proportional to the
size of a repository's metadata history, not its entire content
history. (Exception: the data from inline content is held in memory.)

Guarantee: In the worst case, reposurgeon makes its own copy of every
content blob in the repository's history and thus uses intermediate
disk space approximately equal to the size of a repository's content
history. However, when the repository to be edited is presented as a
stream file, reposurgeon requires no or only very little extra disk
space to represent it; the internal representation of content blobs is
a (seek-offset, length) pair pointing into the stream file.

Guarantee: reposurgeon never modifies the contents of a repository it
reads, nor deletes any repository. The results of surgery are always
expressed in a new repository.

Guarantee: Any line in a fast-import stream that is not a part of a
command reposurgeon parses and understands will be passed through
unaltered.  At present the set of potential passthroughs is known to
include the +progress+, the +options+, and +checkpoint+ commands as
well as comments led by #.

Guarantee: All reposurgeon operations either preserve all repository
state they are not explicitly told to modify or warn you when they
cannot do so.

Guarantee: reposurgeon handles the bzr commit-properties extension,
correctly passing through property items including those with embedded
newlines. (Such properties are also editable in the message-box
format.)

Limitation: In Subversion, sufficiently weird sequences of tag
creations, branch copies from tags, and tag deletions followed by
recreations of the tag can confuse reposurgeon, causing visible
content matches.

Limitation: Because reposurgeon relies on other programs to generate
and interpret the fast-import command stream, it is subject to bugs in
those programs.

Limitation: bzr suffers from deep confusion over whether its unit of
work is a repository or a floating branch that might have been cloned
from a repo or created from scratch, and might or might not be
destined to be merged to a repo one day. Its exporter only works on
branches, but its importer creates repos.  Thus, a rebuild operation
will produce a subdirectory structure that differs from what you
expect.  Look for your content under the subdirectory 'trunk'.

Limitation: under git, signed tags are imported verbatim. However, any
operation that modifies any commit upstream of the target of the
tag will invalidate it.

Limitation: Stock git (at least as of version 1.7.3.2) will choke on
property extension commands. Accordingly, reposurgeon
omits them when rebuilding a repo with git type.

Limitation: Converting an hg repo that uses bookmarks (not
branches) to git can lose information; the branch ref that git assigns
to each commit may not be the same as the hg bookmark that was active
when the commit was originally made under hg.  Unfortunately, this is
a real ontological mismatch, not a problem that can be fixed by
cleverness in reposurgeon.

Limitation: Converting an hg repo that uses branches to git can
lose information because git does not store an explicit branch as part
of commit metadata, but colors commits with branch or tag names on the
fly using a specific coloring algorithm, which might not match the explicit
branch assignments to commits in the original hg repo. Reposurgeon
preserves the hg branch information when reading an hg repo, so it is
available from within reposurgeon itself, but there is no way to preserve
it if the repo is written to git.

Limitation: Not all BitKeeper versions have the fast-import and
fast-export commands that reposurgeon requires.
They are present back to the 7.3 opensource version.

Limitation: reposurgeon may misbehave under a filesystem which smashes
case in filenames, or which nominally preserves case but maps names
differing only by case to the same filesystem node (Mac OS X behaves
like this by default).  Problems will arise if any two paths in a repo
differ by case only. To avoid the problem on a Mac, do all your
surgery on an HFS+ file system formatted with case sensitivity
specifically enabled.

Limitation: If whitespace followed by # appears in a string or
regexp command argument, it will be misinterpreted as the beginning of
a line-ending comment and screw up parsing.

Guarantee: As version-control systems add support for the
fast-import format, their repositories will become editable by
reposurgeon.

Limitations described above are unlikely to change.  Do "help
bugs" at the reposurgeon prompt to see up-to-date information on
reposurgeon bugs and internal problems that are expected to be fixed
in some future release.

[[requirements]]
== REQUIREMENTS ==

reposurgeon relies on importers and exporters
associated with the VCSes it supports.

git::
Core git supports both export and import.

bzr::
Requires bzr plus the bzr-fast-import plugin.

hg::
Requires core hg, the hg-fastimport plugin, and the third-party
hg-fast-export.py script.

svn::
Stock Subversion commands support export and import.

darcs::
Stock darcs commands support export.

CVS::
Requires cvs-fast-export. Note that the quality of CVS lifts may
be poor, with individual lifts requiring serious hand-hacking. This
is due to inherent problems with CVS's file-oriented model.

RCS::
Requires cvs-fast-export (yes, that's not a typo; cvs-fast-export
handles RCS collections as well). The caveat for CVS applies.

[[canonicalization]]
== CANONICALIZATION RULES ==

It is expected that reposurgeon will be extended with more deletion
policies. Policy authors may need to know more about how a commit's
file operation sequence is reduced to normal form after operations
from deleted commits are prepended to it.

Recall that each commit has a list of file operations, each a M
(modify), D (delete), R (rename), C (copy), or 'deleteall' (delete all
files). Only M operations have associated blobs.  Normally there is
only one M operation per individual file in a commit's operation
list.

To understand how the reduction process works, it's enough to
understand the case where all the operation in the list are working
on the same file. Sublists of operations referring to different
files don't affect each other and reducing them can be thought
of as separate operations.  Also, a "deleteall" acts as a D for
everything and cancels all operations before it in the list. 

The reduction process walks through the list from the beginning
looking for adjacent pairs of operations it can compose.  The following table
describes all possible cases and all but one of the reductions.

// &#x2192 is a right arrow 
|==============================================================================
| M + D &#x2192; D                 | If a file is modified then deleted, the
                                     as though it had been  deleted. If the M was the
		                     only modify for the file, it's removed too.
| M a + R a b &#x2192; R a b + M b | The purpose of this transformation is
                                     to push renames toward the beginning of the list,
                                     where they may become adjacent to another R or C they can
                                     be composed with. If the M is the only modify operation for
                                     this file, the rename is dropped.
| M a + C a b                      | No reduction.
| M b + R a b &#x2192; nothing     | Should be impossible, and may
                                     indicate repository corruption.
| M b + C a b &#x2192; nothing     | The copy undoes the modification.
| D + M &#x2192; M                 | If a file is deleted and modified, the result
                                     is as though the deletion had not taken place
                                     (because M operations store entire files, not
                                     deltas).
| D + {D|R|C}                      | These cases should be impossible and would
                                     suggest the repository has been corrupted.
| R a b + D a                      | Should never happen, and is another case
                                     case that would suggest repository corruption.
| R a b + D b &#x2192; D a         | The delete removes the just-renamed file.
| {R|C} + M                        | No reduction.
| R a b + R b c &#x2192; R a c     | The b terms have to match for these
                                     operations to have made sense when they
                                     lived in separate commits; if they
			             don't, it indicates repositorY corruption.
| R a b + C b c                    | No reduction.
| C a b + D a &#x2192; R a b       |  Copy followed by delete of the source is a rename.
| C a b + D b &#x2192; nothing     | This delete undoes the copy.
| C a b + R a c                    | No reduction.
| C a b + R b c &#x2192; C a c     | Copy followed by a rename of the
                                     target reduces to single copy.
| C + C                            | No reduction.
|==============================================================================

[[recovery]]
== CRASH RECOVERY ==

This section will become relevant only if reposurgeon or something
underneath it in the software and hardware stack crashes while in the
middle of writing out a repository, in particular if the target
directory of the rebuild is your current directory.

The tool has two conflicting objectives. On the one hand, we
never want to risk clobbering a pre-existing repo.  On the other hand,
we want to be able to run this tool in a directory with a repo and
modify it in place.

We resolve this dilemma by playing a game of three-directory monte.

. First, we build the repo in a freshly-created staging
directory.  If your target directory is named
<filename>/path/to/foo_, the staging directory will be a
peer named <filename>/path/to/foo-stageNNNN_, where NNNN is
a cookie derived from reposurgeon's process
ID.</step>

. We then make an empty backup directory.  This directory will
be named <filename>/path/to/foo.~N~_, where N is incremented
so as not to conflict with any existing backup directories.
reposurgeon never, under any circumstances,
ever deletes a backup directory.
+
So far, all operations are safe; the worst that can happen up to
this point if the process gets interrupted is that the staging and
backup directories get left behind.

. The critical region begins. We first move everything in the
target directory to the backup directory.

. Then we move everything in the staging directory to the
target.

.  We finish off by restoring untracked files in the target
directory from the backup directory. That ends the critical
region.

During the critical region, all signals that can be ignored are
ignored.
