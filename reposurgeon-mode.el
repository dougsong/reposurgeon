;; A mode for editing the mailbox-like comment dumps produced by reposurgeon.
;;
;; Canonicalizing thousands of comments in a mailbox_out dump is the grottiest
;; part of lifting a repository, but if you don't do it you are probably going
;; to miss things that should turn into reference cookies.  This mode aims to
;; speed up the process.
;;
;; Work in progress - neither code nor bindings should be considered stable.
