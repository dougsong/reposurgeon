Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>

== Overview ==

Distributed version control systems (DVCSes) are powerful and
liberating tools for software developers, but projects aiming to
choose one of the major contenders can find themselves mired in
contention and politics.  The most common such controversy is whether
to use git or hg (aka Mercurial).  With a little planning it's
possible to have it both ways, allowing developers to use either git
or hg to work with the same repository.  It is even possible 
to support a CVS emulation from the same repository.

This page is a guide to up-converting your repository, finding the
tools you need, and adopting practices that will reduce process and
political friction to a minimum.

The technical fact central to the strategy I'm going to describe is
that as of late 2011 an hg plugin already exists to allow seamless
access to a git repository, and as of 2013 recent versions of git can
clone from and push to Mercurial repos.  We'll walk through how to
up-convert a git repository and then line up the tools to access it in
several different ways.

But tools aren't the end of the story. Your developers will need
some education in good practice to get the most out of the tools.
I'll cover that aspect as well.

In 90% of cases you'll be converting from CVS or Subversion, and those
are the cases we'll discuss in detail.  If you're using something
older or weirder, see the short section on other VCSes for some hints,
but you're mostly on your own.

== Commercial Note ==

If you are an organization that pays programmers and has a
requirement to do a repository conversion, the author can be
mailto:esr@thyrsus.com[engaged] to perform or assist with
the transition.  You are likely to find this is more efficient than
paying someone in-house for the time required to learn the tools and
procedures. I have been very open about my methods here, but
nothing substitues for experience when you need it done quickly
and right.

== Step Zero: Preparation ==

Create a scratch directory for your conversion work.

Copy http://catb.org/~esr/reposurgeon/conversion.mk[this
generic makefile] designed to sequence conversions to be the
Makefile in your conversion directory. Then set the variables near the
top appropriately for your project. You will need the reposurgeon
tools installed to use it.

This Makefile will help you avoid typing a lot of fiddly commands 
by hand, and ensure that later products of the conversion pipeline
are always updated when earlier ones have been modified or removed.

Create an empty file named $(PROJECT).lift.  The Makefile will use
it. Later, you will put your custom commands in here. Doing this helps
you not lose older steps as you experiment with newer ones, and it
documents what you did.

Doing a high-quality repository conversion is not a simple job and
the odds that you will get it perfectly right the first time are close
to zero. By packaging your lift commands in a repeatable script and
using the Makefile to sequence repetitive operations, you will reduce the
overhead of experimenting.

In the rest of the steps we describe below, when we write "make
foo" that means the step can be sequenced by the "foo" production 
in the Makefile. Replace $(PROJECT) with your project name.

You may find it instructive to type "make -n" to see what the
entire conversion sequence will look like. 

== Step One: The Author Map ==

Subversion and CVS identify users by a Unix login name local to the
repository host; DVCSes use pairs of fullnames and email addresses.
Before you can finish your conversion, you'll need to put together an
author map that maps the former to the latter; the Makefile assumes
this is named $(PROJECT).map.  The author map should specify a full
name and email address for each local user ID in the repo you're
converting. Each line should be in the following form:

...................................................................
foonly = Fred Foonly <foonly@foobar.com>
...................................................................

You can optionally specify an third field that is a timezone
description, either an ISO8601 offset (like "-0500") or a named 
entry in the Unix timezone file (like "America/Chicago").  If you do,
this timezone will be attached to the timestamps on commits made by
this person.

Using the generic Makefile for Subversion, "make stubmap" will
generate a start on an author-map file as $(PROJECT).map.  Edit in real
names and addresses (and optionally offsets) to the right of
the equals signs.

How best to get this information will vary depending on your
situation.

* If you can get shell access to the repository host, looking at
`/etc/passwd` will give you the real name corresponding to
each username of a developer still active: usually you can simply
append @ and the repository hostname to each username to get a valid
email address.  You can do this automatically, and merge in real
names from the password file, using the 'repomapper' tool from the
reposurgeon distribution.

* If the repository is owned by a project on a forge site, you
can usually get the real name information through the Web interface;
try looking for the project membership or developer's list
information.

* If the project has a development mailing list, posting your
incomplete map with a request for completions often gives good results.

* If you can download the archives of the project's development
mailing list, grepping out all the From addresses may suggest some
obvious matches with otherwise unknown usernames.

If you are converting the repository for an open-source project, it is
good courtesy and good practice after the above first step to email
the contributors and invite them to supply a preferred form of their
name, a preferred email address to be used in the mapping, and a
timezone offset.  The reason for this is that some sites, like
https://www.ohloh.net[OpenHub], aggregate participation statistics
(and thus, reputation) across many projects, using developer name and
email address as a primary key.

Your authors file does not have to be final until you ship your
converted repo, so you can chase down authors' preferred
identifications in parallel with the rest of the work.

== Step Two: Conversion ==

Your first step will be converting your repository to git. 

There are at least half a dozen utilities out there for lifting CVS
and Subversion repositories to a git repository or import stream.  My
opinion of them can be gauged by the fact that I wrote my own:
reposurgeon. You can read a
http://www.catb.org/~esr/reposurgeon/features.html[description] of the
things it does that other conversion tools don't.)

So, install reposurgeon and whatever tool it needs to read your
repository.  That will be
http://www.catb.org/~esr/cvs-fast-export[cvs-fast-export] for CVS, or
the Subversion tools themselves for Subversion.

The generic-workflow Makefile will call reposurgeon
for you, interpreting your $(PROJECT).lift file, when you type "make".
You may have to watch the baton spin for a few minutes.

=== CVS ===

If you are exporting from CVS, it may be a good idea to run some
trial conversions with cvsconvert, a wrapper script shipped with
cvs-fast-export.  This script runs a conversion direct to git;
the advantage is that it can do a comparison of the repository
histories and identify problems for you to fix in your lift
script.

Problems in CVS conversions generally arise from the fact that CVS's
data model doesn't have real multi-file changesets, which are the
fundamental unit of a commit in DVCSes.  It can be difficult to fully
recover changesets from what are actually large numbers of single-file
changes flying in loose formation - in fact, old CVS operator errors
can sometimes make it impossible. Bad tools silently propagate such
damage forward into your translation. Good tools, like cvs-fast-export
and reposurgeon, warn you of problems and help you recover.

=== Subversion ===

Normally reposurgeon will do branch analysis for you.
On most Subversion repositories, and in particular anything with a
standard trunk/tags/branches layout, it will do the right thing. (It
will also cope with adventitious branches in the root directory of the
repo, such as many projects use for website content.)  In unusual
cases you may want to use the "--nobranch" option; find out more
about this from the manual page.

To my knowledge, reposurgeon is the only conversion
tool that handles multibranch Subversion repositories in full
generality. It can even translate Subversion commits that alter
multiple branches.

Special Google Code note: If you are converting a Subversion
project from Google Code, you may want to use the command "debranch
wiki" to turn the wiki branch into a subdirectory on your master
branch.

Performance tip: reposurgeon should analyze Subversion
repositories at the rate of over 10K commits per minute, but that rate
falls off somewhat on very large repositories (apparently due to I/O
costs). You can speed it up significantly by building a binary with
http://cython.org/[cython]; there's a production to do this
in the reposurgeon Makefile.

Unlike CVS, Subversion repositories have real changesets and the work
in them can effectively always be mapped unto equivalent DVCS commits.
The parent-child relationships among commits will also translate
cleanly.  There is, however, a minor problem around tags, and a
significant problem around merges.

The tag problem arises because Subversion tags are really branches
that you've conventionally agreed not to commit to after the initial
branch copy (that's what the tags/ directory name conveys).  But
Subversion doesn't enforce any prohibition against committing to
the tag branch, and various odd things can happen if you do.  The
reposurgeon analyzer warns about these cases, and reposurgeon gives
you tools for coping with them.

In a DVCS, a merge normally coalesces two entire branches.  Subversion
has something close to this in newer versions; it's called a "sync
merge" working on directories (and is expressed as an svn:mergeinfo
property of the target directory that names the source).  A sync merge
of a branch directory into another branch directory behaves like a
DVCS merge; reposurgeon picks these up and translates them for you.

The older, more basic Subversion merge is per file and is expressed by
per-file svn:mergeinfo properties.  These correspond to what in
DVCS-land are called "cherry-picks", which just replay a commit from a
source branch onto a target branch but do *not* create cross-branch
links.

Sometimes Subversion developers use collections of per-file mergeinfo
properties to express partial branch merges.  This does not map to
the DVCS model at all well, and trying to promote these to full-branch
merges by hand is actually dangerous.  An excellent essay,
https://plus.google.com/100357083629018071519/posts/jG7CN9R1SsZ[Partial
git merges -- just say no.] explores the problem in depth.  

The bottom line is that reposurgeon warns about per-file svn:mergeinfo
properties _and then discards them_ for good reasons.  If you feel an
urge to hand-edit in a branch merge based on these, do so with care
and check your work.

=== Other VCSes ===

SCCS: Use http://www.catb.org/esr/sccs2rcs/[sccs2rcs]
to get to RCS, then follow the directions for RCS. There is a script
called sccs2git on CPAN which I don't recommend, as it is poorly
documented and makes no attempt to group commits into changesets.

RCS: reposurgeon will read an RCS collection.  It uses
http://www.catb.org/~esr/cvs-fast-export[cvs-fast-export],
which despite its name does not actually require CVS metadata other than
the RCS master files that store the content.

Fossil: reposurgeon will read a Fossil repository file. It uses the
native Fossil exporter, which is pretty good but doesn't export ignore
patterns, wiki events, or tickets.

For other systems, see the
https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/InterfacesFrontendsAndTools#Interaction_with_other_Revision_Control_Systems[Git
wiki page on conversion tools].

== Step Three: Sanity Checking ==

Before putting in further effort on polishing your your conversion
and putting it into production, you should check it for basic
correctness.

Pay attention to error messages emitted during the lift.  Most
of these, and remedial actions to take, are described in the
reposurgeon manual.

For Subversion lifts, use the "compare" and "compare-tags"
productions to compare the head revision and tagged revisions between
the unconverted repostory.  If you didn't use the cvsconvert wrapper
for your CVS lift, these productions have a similar effect. The only
differences you should see are those due to keyword expansion and
ignore-file lifting.  If this is not true, you have found a serious
bug in either reposurgeon or the front end it used. Consult
http://www.catb.org/~esr/reposurgeon/reporting-bugs.html for
information on how to usefully report bugs.

If you are converting from CVS, use reposurgeon's graph command to
examine the conversion, looking (in particular) for misplaced tags or
branch joins. Often these can be manually repaired with little
effort. These flaws do 'not' necessarily imply bugs in cvs-fast-export
or reposurgeon; they may simply indicate previously undetected
malformations in the history. However, reporting them may help improve
cvs-fast-export.

== Step Four: Cleanup ==

You should now have a git repository, but it is likely to have a
lot of cruft and conversion artifacts in it.  Here are some common
forms of cruft:

Subversion and CVS commit references::
    Often Subversion references will be in the form 'r' followed by a
    string of digits referring to a Subversion commit number. But not
    always; humans come up with lots of ambiguous ways to write these.
    CVS commit references are even harder to spot mechanically, as they're
    just groups of digits separated by dots with no identifing prefix.  A
    clean conversion should turn all these into VCS-independent commit
    references, which I'll describe later in this document.

Multiline contents with no summary::
    git and hg both encourage comments to begin with a summary line
    that can stand alone as a short description of the change; this
    practice produces more readable output from `git log`
    and `hg log`. For a really high-quality conversion, 
    multiline comments should be edited into this form.

No-fileop commits::
    Commits with no fileops are automatically transformed into tags
    when reading a Subversion repository.  Other importers may generate
    them for various reasons; you can detect them as the =Z visibility
    set. In order to preserve the behavior that read followed by immediate
    write does not modify a stream file, this simplification is not done
    by default.

Branch tip deletes, deletealls, and unexpressed merges::
    In Subversion it is common practice to delete a branch directory
    when that line of development is finished or merged to trunk; this
    makes sense because it reduces the checkout size of the repo in later
    revisions. In a DVCS, deletes at a branch tip don't save you any
    storage, so it makes more sense to leave the branch with all of its
    tip content live if you're not going to delete it entirely. Sometimes
    editing a later commit to have the branch tip as a parent (creating
    a merge that Subversion could not express) make sense; look for
    svn:mergeinfo properties as clues.

Commits generated by *cvs2svn* to carry tag information::
    These lurk in the history of a lot of Subversion projects.
    Sometimes these junk commits are empty (no file operations associated
    with them at all); sometimes they're translated as long lists of
    spurious delete fileops, and sometimes they have actual file content
    (duplicating parent file versions, or referring randomly to file
    versions far older than the junk commit). Older versions of
    `cvs2svn` seem to have generated all kinds of meaningless
    crud into these.

Metadata inserted by git-svn::
    `git-svn` inserts lines at the end of each commit
    comment that refer back to the Subversion commit it is derived from.  This
    is necessary for live-gatewaying, and useful during one-shot
    conversions, but you will probably not want it in the final repo.

=== Surgical cleanup using reposurgeon ===

You can use http://www.catb.org/esr/reposurgeon/[reposurgeon] to clean
up all these sorts of problems; it's specifically designed for this
job. The remainder of this section explains reposurgeon
commands for common problems; the tool has a lot of additional power
for dealing with unusual situations

Here's a checklist of manual cleanup steps. Tips on how to do them
with reposurgeon follow.

1. Map author IDs from local to DVCS form.

2. Check for leftover cvs2svn junk commits and remove them if possible.

3. Lift references in commit comments.

4. Massage comments into summary-line-plus-continuation form.

5. Remove empty and delete-only tip commits where appropriate.

6. Review generated tags, pruning as appropriate.

7. Look for branch merge points and patch parent marks to make them.

8. Fix up or remove $-keyword cookies in the latest revision.

9. If there's a root branch, check for and remove junk commits on it.

10. For the record, make a tag noting time and date of the repo lift.

11. If your target was git, run  `git gc &#45;&#45;aggressive`.

Most of the work will be in the comment-fixup and reference-lifting
stages. I find, however, that they normally take only a couple of
hours even on very large repos with thousands of commits. An entire
conversion is usually less than a day of work.

You can use the `authors read` command to perform the
author-ID mapping operation with reposurgeon.

You can find empty commits as the =Z visibility set set and clean
them up with the command `tagify`. Consult the
reposurgeon manual page for usage details.
			       
The command `/cvs2svn/ list` will show you all remaining
`cvs2svn` artifacts.  Some can be deleted; a clue to look
for is junk commits generated to carry a tag at branch tips that have
one or two M fileops referring to a blob much earlier than the commit.
Very occasionally the generated commits will have real fileops on
them; all you can do in this case is note conversion damage in the
comment and move on.

Another good way to spot junk commits is to eyeball the picture of
the commit DAG created by the reposurgeon 'graph' command
- they tend to stand out visually as leaf nodes in odd places. Be
aware that the graph command outputs DOT, the language interpreted by
the http://www.graphviz.org/[graphviz] suite; you will
need a DOT rendering program and an image viewer.

See the documentation of the `references` command; for
details on how fix up Subversion and CVS changeset references in
comments so they're still meaningful.

The command `=L edit` is good for fixing up
multiline comments.

The reposurgeon command `inspect =H` will
show you tip commits which may contain only deletes and
deletealls.

Tags can be inspected with `=T inspect`. Junk tags can
be removed with the `delete` commmand. Tag comments can be
modified with `edit`.

Version 2.x and later of reposurgeon have a new
`merge` command specifically for performing branch merges.
The `edit` command will also allow you to add a parent mark
to a commit.

One minor feature you lose in moving from CVS or Subversion to a
DVCS is keyword expansion.  You should go through the last revision of
the code and remove $Id$, $Date$, $Revision$, and other keyword
cookies lest they become unhelpful fossils. A command like `grep -R
'$[A-Z]' .` may be helpful.

After conversion of a branchy repository, look to see if there is a 
'root' branch.  If there are any commits with a sufficiently
pathological structure that reposurgeon can't figure out
what branch they belong to, they'll wind up there. Certain odd
combinations of Subversion branch creation and deletion operations may
do this, producing spurious deleteall commits; the results have to
be garbage-collected by hand.

It's good practice to leave a commit in the stream noting the date 
and time of the repo lift.  See the next section on conversion
comments for discussion.

Experiments with reposurgeon suggest that `git
import` doesn't try to pack or otherwise optimize for space when
it populates a repo from a dump file; this produces large
repositories.  Running `git repack` and `git gc
&#45;&#45;aggressive` can slim them down quite a lot.

=== Conversion comments ===

Sometimes, in converting a repository, you may need to insert an
explanatory comment - for example, if metadata has been garbled or
missing and you need to point to that fact.

It's helpful for repository-browsing tools if there is a uniform
syntax for this that is highly unlikely to show up in repository
comments.  I recommend enclosing translation notes in [[ ]].  This 
has the advantage of being visually similar to the [ ] traditionally
used for editorial comments in text.

It is good practice to include, in the root commit of the
repository, a note dating and attributing the conversion work and
explaining these conventions.  Example:

------------------------------------------------------------------
[[This repository was converted from Subversion to git on 2012-10-24
by Eric S. Raymond &lt;esr@thyrsus.com&gt;.  Here and elsewhere, conversion
notes are enclosed in double square brackets. Junk commits generated
by cvs2svn have been removed, commit references have been mapped into
a uniform VCS-independent syntax, and some comments edited into
summary-plus-continuation form.]]
------------------------------------------------------------------

You should also, as previously noted, leave a tag in the normal
commit sequence noting the switchover.  You can do this with
the `mailbox --create` command; see the reposurgeon
manual page for details and an example.

=== Nonsurgical cleanup steps ===

You'll want to run through the repository removing
CVS and Subversion keyword-expansion headers.  "grep -R '\\$[A-Z]' ."
will turn these up.  Note that if you've been relying on these
to supply version strings that are visible at runtime, you will
need to supply that information in some different way.

A step that too often gets missed and then inelegantly patched in
later is converting the declarations that tell the version-control
system to ignore derived files. reposurgeon does this for
you if you're using it for CVS- or Subversion-to-git conversion, both
expressing Subversion svn:ignore properties as .gitignore files 
and lifting .cvsignore files to .gitignore files; see the
LIMITATIONS AND GUARANTEES section on its manpage if other DVCSes are
involved.

Under versions of reposurgeon before 3.11 (August 2014) explicit
.gitignore files in Subversion repositories were preserved and could
interfere with .gitignore files generated from svn:ignore properties
during the conversion.  Under 3.11 and later the assumption is that
these were created by git-svn users ad hoc and should be discarded;
it is up to the human doing the conversion to look through them
and rescue any ignore patterns that should be merged into the
converted repository.

=== Recovering from errors ===

Occasionally you'll discover problems with a conversion after you've
pushed it to a project's hosting site, typically to a bare repo that
the hosting software created for you.  Here's how to cope:

1. Do your surgery on a copy of the repo with its .git/config
pointing to the public location.

2. Warn the public repo's users that it is briefly going out 
of service and they will need to re-clone it afterwards!

3. Ensure that it is possible to force-push to the repository.
How you do this will vary depending on your hosting site.

4. On gitlab.com, under Settings, there is a "Protected Branches"
item you can use. If you unprotect a branch, you can force-push to it.
+
Elsewhere, you may be able to re-initialize the public repo (this
works, for example, on SourceForge). You'll need ssh access to the
bare repo directory on the host - let's suppose it's 'myproject'. Pop
up to the enclosing directory and do this:
+
........................................................................
    mv myproject myproject-hidden
    rm -fr myproject-hidden/*
    git init &#45;&#45;bare myproject-hidden
    mv myproject-hidden myproject
........................................................................
+
The point of doing it this way is (a) so you never actually remove
myproject (on many hosts you will not have create permissions in the
enclosing directory), and (b) so no user can update the repo while 
you're clearing it (mv is atomic).
+
After re-initializing, you should be able to run `git
push` to push the new history up to the public repo.

5. From your modified local repo, try 
+
........................................................................
     git push --mirror --force
........................................................................
+
to push the new history up to the public repo.

6. Inform the public repo's users that it is available and remind
them that they will need to re-clone it.

== Step Five: Client Tools ==

Developers who are already git fans and know how to use a git
client will, of course, have no partiticular trouble using a git
repository.

Windows users accustomed to working through TortoiseSVN can move to
http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/[TortoiseGIT].

Developers who like hg can use the http://hg-git.github.com/[hg-git
mercurial plugin]. There is an Ubuntu package "mercurial-git" for
this, and other distributions are likely to carry it as well.

There are some hg-git limitations to be aware of. In order to
simulate git behavior, hg-git keeps some local state in the .hg
directories; a map from git branch names to Mercurial commits, a list
of Mercurial bookmarks describing git branches (which have
bookmark-like behavior different from a Mercurial named branch) and a
file mapping git SHA1 hashes to hg SHA1 hashes (both systems use them
as commit IDs).  The problem is that hg doesn't copy any of this local
state when it clones a repo, so clones of hg-git repos lose their
git branches and tags.

If you have developers attached to the CVS interface, it is possible
(and in fact relatively easy) to set up a gateway interface that lets
them continue using their CVS client tools.  Consult the documentation
for
https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-cvsserver.html[git-cvsserver].

== Step Six: Good Practice ==

Since the object of this exercise is to support both git and hg
fans, both groups need to use the repo in a way that doesn't assume
the other group will understand artifacts (like commit hashes) that
are specific to either VCS.

Being careful about this has an additional benefit.  Someday your
project may need to change VCSes yet again; on that day, it will be
extremely helpful if nobody has to try to convert years' or decades' 
worth of VCS-specific magic cookies in the history.

Educate your developers in the following good practices:

=== Commit references ===

The combination of a committer email address with a ISO8601
timestamp is a good way to refer to a commit without being
VCS-specific.  Thus, instead of "commit 304a53c2",
"2011-10-25T15:11:09Z!fred@foonly.com". I recommend that you _not
vary from this format_, even in trivial ways like omitting the 'Z'
or changing the 'T' or '!'. Making these cookies uniform and
machine-parseable will have good consequences for future
repository-browsing tools. The reference-lifting code in
reposurgeon generates them.

Sometimes it's enough to quote the summary line of a commit. So,
instead of "Back out most of commit 304a53c2", you might write 
"Back out 'Attempted divide-by-zero fix'.".

When appropriate. "my last commit" is simple and effective.

=== Comment summary lines ===

As previously noted, git and hg both want comments to begin with a
summary line that can stand alone as a short description of the
change; this may optionally be followed by a aeparating blank line
and details in whatever form the commenter likes.

Try to end summary lines with a period.  Ending punctuation other
than a period should be used to indicate that the summary line is
incomplete and continues after the separator; "..." is conventional.

For best results, stay within 72 characters per line.  Don't go
over 80.

Good comment practice produces more readable output from `git
log` and `hg log`, and makes it easy to take in
whole sequences of changes at a glance.
