			reposurgeon project news

0.9:
     Can now handle 'N' file operations; they're passed through.
     The 'stats' command can now take a list of repo names as arguments.
     The file extension ".fi" is now removed from the in-core names of
     repositories read from plain files
     Fixed an embarrassing bug in the rebuild code

0.8: 2010-11-19
     This is a beta. It is likely the next release will be 1.0.
     Expunge now saves deleted material into a new repository, so it can
     be used to carve up repositories by file path match.
     New 'renumber' command, in case importers ever care about marks 
     being consecutive.
     Allow Passthrough events to be merged.
     After a cut operation, option and feature events in the original
     repo will be duplicated onto the late fragment as well as remaing
     on the early one.

0.7: 2010-11-15
     Added 'merge' command that merges repositories.

0.6: 2010-11-10
     Tweaked to pass through git submodules without failing.
     Also contains a fix for a subtle bug in error handling.

0.5: 2010-11-09
     We can round-trip bzr dumps with commit properties.
     New 'split' operation, opposite of coalesce/delete.
     Multiple author headers per commit are handled (helps with bzr).

0.4: 2010-11-08
     Handling of inline data, previously extremely buggy, has been fixed.
     Can now handle streams produced by bzr-fast-export, which uses inline.
     Unfortunately, bzr-fast-import is buggy enough to make rebuilds fail.
     First cut at hg support, by Phil Roberts.

0.3: 2010-11-07
     'split' operation renamed to 'cut'.
     New 'inspect' command for looking at commits in raw form.
     'list' command adapts to current width of terminal window.
     Issue a baton prompt during repo cleanup, which can be a long process.
     Multiple instances can now run in the same directory.
     Some speedup on import and export.

0.2: 2010-11-04
     Filenames with embedded whitespace are handled. 
     The 'expunge' operation to remove files from the history is working.
     The 'split' operation (topological cut) is now working.
     There is a new 'drop' command to drop repositories from the load list.
     There is a new 'history' command to display your session history.
     The 'view' command was a bad idea and has been removed.
     & followed by branch name resolves to everything on the branch.
     A bug that caused spurious date modifications when editing events
     with a non-local timezone has been fixed.
