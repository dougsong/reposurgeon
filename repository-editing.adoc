== Quick start

As a motivating example, here are commands to do a Subversion-to
Git lift on a repository mamed _project_ just under the current directory:

--------
# Load the project into main memory
# Warning: this command is slow because Subversion is slow.
read project

# Map Subversion usernames to Git-style user IDs.  In a real
# conversion you'd probably have a lot more of these and you'd
# probably read them in from a separate file, not a heredoc.

Typically you'd have these commands in a script that you evolved by
experimenting until you got a conversion that suited your tastes and
needs.

[[introduction]]
== Introduction

The purpose of reposurgeon is to enable risky operations that VCSes
(version-control systems) don't want to let you do, such as (a)
editing past comments and metadata, (b) excising commits, (c)
coalescing and splitting commits, (d) removing files and subtrees from
repo history, (e) merging or grafting two or more repos, and (f)
cutting a repo in two by cutting a parent-child link, preserving the
branch structure of both child repos.

A major use of reposurgeon is to assist a human operator to perform
higher-quality conversions among version control systems than can be
achieved with fully automated converters. Another application is when
code needs to be removed from a repository from repositories for legal
or policy reasons.

Fully supported systems (those for which reposurgeon can both read and
write repositories) include git, hg, bzr, darcs, bk, RCS, and SRC.
For a complete list, with dependencies and technical notes, type
"prefer" to the reposurgeon prompt.

Writing to the file-oriented systems RCS and SRC has some
serious limitations because those systems cannot represent all the
metadata in a git-fast-export stream. Consult that tool's
documentation for details and partial workarounds.

Fossil repository files can be read in using the `--format=fossil`
option of the '```read```' command and written out with the
`--format=fossil` option of the '```write```'. Ignore patterns are not
translated in either direction.

SVN and CVS are supported for read only, not write.  For CVS,
reposurgeon must be run from within a repository directory (one with a
CVSROOT subdirectory), not a checkout. Each module becomes a
subdirectory in the reposurgeon representation of the change history.

Note that reposurgeon is a sharp enough tool to cut you.  It takes
care not to ever write a repository in an actually inconsistent state,
and will terminate with an error message rather than proceed when its
internal data structures are confused.  However, there are lots of
things you can do with it - like altering stored commit timestamps so
they no longer match the commit sequence - that are likely to cause
havoc after you're done.  Proceed with caution and check your work.

Also note that, if your DVCS does the usual thing of making
commit IDs a cryptographic hash of content and parent links, editing a
publicly-accessible repository with this tool would be a bad idea. All
of the surgical operations in reposurgeon will
modify the hash chains.

Please also see the notes on system-specific issues under
<<limitations>>.

[[conversion]]
== A Guide to Repository Conversion

One of the main uses for reposurgeon is converting repositories
between different version-control systems. In the year 2020,
this usually means convering from something else to Git.

This section is a guide to up-converting your repository, and adopting
practices that will reduce process friction to a minimum.  It is meant
to provide context for the description of reposurgeon's features in
later sections.

If you are aiming at something other than a repository conversion,
you can safely skip this section.

In 90% of cases you'll be converting from CVS or Subversion, and those
are the cases we'll discuss in detail.  If you're using something
older or weirder, see the short section on other VCSes for some hints,
but you're mostly on your own.

[[why-reposurgeon]]
=== Why convert with reposurgeon?

Reposurgeon is more difficult to use that any of dozens
of fully-automated conversion tools out there; you have to make
choices and compose a recipe. This section explains why it's
worth the bother.

In brief, it's because fully automated converters don't work very
well.  They are very poor at dealing with the ontological mismatches
between the data models of different version-control systems. For
detailed discussion of the technical flaws in many common converters,
see Appendix A.

But even automated converters that are relatively good at bridging
data-model differences tend to produce crude, jackleg, unidiomatic
conversions that make the seam between the pre-conversion and
post-conversion parts of the repository very obvious.

An important example of this is commit references in change
comments. These references convey important information to anyone
reading the comments, and it is correspondingly important to change
them from using the reference format of the old system to one that is
intelligible in whatever your new one is.

As another example, git has a convention about the form of change comments;
they're supposed to consist of a standalone summary line, followed
optionally by a spacer blank line and running text.  Git relies on
this convention to produce log summeries that are easy to take in at a
glance.

Older version-control systems don't have this convention.  An ideal
conversion changes as many comments as possible to be in Git-like form so
that the Git summary tools see the data regularity they want.  But
this kind of editing can't be fully automated.  The best you can hope
for, if you want to do it right, is that your tool automates as much
of this fixup as it can *and* it assists a human operator in
applying fixups.

Neither reference-lifting nor patching comments for Git-friendliness
is a process that can be fully automated.  Both require human
judgment; accordingly, automateds converters don't even try to
do the right thing.  The result is often a history that is full of
unpleasant little speedbumps and distractions.  These induce
wasted developer effort and, correspondingly, higher defect rates. 

On the other hand, a skilled operator of reposurgeon can produce a
conversion that is fully idiomatic in the target system, significantly
lowering future friction costs for developers browsing the history.

[[commercial]]
=== Commercial Note

If you are an organization that pays programmers and has a
requirement to do a repository conversion, the author can be
mailto:esr@thyrsus.com[engaged] to perform or assist with
the transition.  You are likely to find this is more efficient than
paying someone in-house for the time required to learn the tools and
procedures. I (the author) have been very open about my methods here, but
nothing substitutes for experience when you need it done quickly
and right.

If you are wondering why it's worth spending any money at all for
a real history conversion, as opposed to just starting a new
repository with a snapshot of the old head revision, the answer
comes down to two words: risk management.

Suppose you do a snapshot conversion, head revision only. Then you get
a regression report with a way to reproduce the problem. What you want
to do is bisect in the new history to identify the revision where the
bug was introduced, because knowing what the breaking change was makes
a fix far easier. Bzzzt! You canâ€™t. That history is missing in the
new system.

Yes, in theory you could run a manual bisection using bracketing
builds in new and old repositories. Until you have tried this, you
will have no comprehension of how easy it is to get that process
slightly but fatally wrong, and (actually more importantly) how
difficult it is _to be sure you havenâ€™t gotten it wrong._ This is the
kind of friction cost that sounds minor until the first time it blows
up on you and eats man-weeks of NRE.

So congratulations, tracing the bug just got an order of magnitude
more expensive in engineer time, and your expected time to fix changed
proportionally. It typically only takes one of these incidents to
justify the up-front cost of having had the conversion done right.

If you go the snapshot-conversion route, maybe youâ€™ll get lucky and
never need visibility further back. Or maybe youâ€™ll have a disaster
because you increased the friction costs of debugging just enough that
you, say, miss a critical ship date. The more experienced with
in-the-trenches software development you are, the more plausible that
second scenario will sound.

A subtler issue is that by losing the old change comments you have
thrown away a great deal of hard-won knowledge about why your code is
written the way it is. Again, this may never matter â€“ but if it does,
itâ€™s going to bite you on the butt, hard, probably when you least
expect it.

And if you're thinking "No problem, the old repository will still be
around"...heh. Repositories that have become seldom-accessed are like
other kinds of dead storage in that they have a way of quietly
disappearing because after a few job turnovers the knowledge of why
theyâ€™re important is lost. Typically you donâ€™t find out this has
happened until you have an unanticipated urgent need, at which point
whatever trouble you were in gets deeper.

Spending the relatively small amount takes to have a proper full
conversion done right is a way of bounding your downside risk.
If you aren't a software engineer and had trouble following
the preceding argument, propose a snapshot conversion to the
engineer you trust the most and watch that person reaching for
a diplomatic way to tell you it's a stupid, shortsighted idea.

[[preparation]]
=== Step Zero: Preparation

Make sure the tools in the reposurgeon suite (especially reposurgeon
and repotool) are on your $PATH

Create a scratch directory for your conversion work.

Run "repotool initialize" in the scratch directory.  This will create
a Makefile designed to sequence your conversion, and an empty lift
script. Then set the variables near the top appropriately for your
project.

This Makefile will help you avoid typing a lot of fiddly commands 
by hand, and ensure that later products of the conversion pipeline
are always updated when earlier ones have been modified or removed.

Later, you will put your custom commands in the lift script
file. Doing this helps you not lose older steps as you experiment with
newer ones, and it documents what you did.

Doing a high-quality repository conversion is not a simple job and
the odds that you will get it perfectly right the first time are close
to zero. By packaging your lift commands in a repeatable script and
using the Makefile to sequence repetitive operations, you will reduce the
overhead of experimenting.

In the rest of the steps we describe below, when we write "make
foo" that means the step can be sequenced by the "foo" production 
in the Makefile.  Replace $(PROJECT) in these instructions with
your project name.

You may find it instructive to type "make -n" to see what the
entire conversion sequence will look like. 

[[authormap]]
=== Step One: The Author Map

Subversion and CVS identify users by a Unix login name local to the
repository host; DVCSes use pairs of fullnames and email addresses.
Before you can finish your conversion, you'll need to put together an
author map that maps the former to the latter; the Makefile assumes
this is named $(PROJECT).map.  The author map should specify a full
name and email address for each local user ID in the repo you're
converting. Each line should be in the following form:

...................................................................
foonly = Fred Foonly <foonly@foobar.com>
...................................................................

You can optionally specify an third field that is a timezone
description, either an ISO8601 offset (like "-0500") or a named 
entry in the Unix timezone file (like "America/Chicago").  If you do,
this timezone will be attached to the timestamps on commits made by
this person.

Using the generic Makefile for Subversion, "make stubmap" will
generate a start on an author-map file as $(PROJECT).map.  Edit in real
names and addresses (and optionally offsets) to the right of
the equals signs.

How best to get this information will vary depending on your
situation.

* If you can get shell access to the repository host, looking at
`/etc/passwd` will give you the real name corresponding to
each username of a developer still active: usually you can simply
append @ and the repository hostname to each username to get a valid
email address.  You can do this automatically, and merge in real
names from the password file, using the 'repomapper' tool from the
reposurgeon distribution.

* If the repository is owned by a project on a forge site, you
can usually get the real name information through the Web interface;
try looking for the project membership or developer's list
information.

* If the project has a development mailing list, posting your
incomplete map with a request for completions often gives good results.

* If you can download the archives of the project's development
mailing list, grepping out all the From addresses may suggest some
obvious matches with otherwise unknown usernames. You may also
be able to get timezone offsets from the date stamps on the mail.

If you are converting the repository for an open-source project, it is
good courtesy and good practice after the above first step to email
the contributors and invite them to supply a preferred form of their
name, a preferred email address to be used in the mapping, and a
timezone offset.  The reason for this is that some sites, like
https://www.openhub.net/[OpenHub], aggregate participation statistics
(and thus, reputation) across many projects, using developer name and
email address as a primary key.

Your authors file does not have to be final until you ship your
converted repo, so you can chase down authors' preferred
identifications in parallel with the rest of the work.

=== Step Two: Conversion

Install whatever front end repsurgeon needs to read your
repository.  That will be
http://www.catb.org/~esr/cvs-fast-export[cvs-fast-export] for CVS, or
the Subversion tools themselves for Subversion.

The generic-workflow Makefile will call reposurgeon
for you, interpreting your $(PROJECT).lift file, when you type "make".
You may have to watch the baton spin for a few minutes.  For very
large repositories it could be more than a few minutes.

This will convert your repository to git. If you need to export
to something else, reposurgeon has write support for a couple of
other modern VCSes.

==== CVS

If you are exporting from CVS, it may be a good idea to run some
trial conversions with cvsconvert, a wrapper script shipped with
cvs-fast-export.  This script runs a conversion direct to git;
the advantage is that it can do a comparison of the repository
histories and identify problems for you to fix in your lift
script.

Problems in CVS conversions generally arise from the fact that CVS's
data model doesn't have real multi-file changesets, which are the
fundamental unit of a commit in DVCSes.  It can be difficult to fully
recover changesets from what are actually large numbers of single-file
changes flying in loose formation - in fact, old CVS operator errors
can sometimes make it impossible. Bad tools silently propagate such
damage forward into your translation. Good tools, like cvs-fast-export
and reposurgeon, warn you of problems and help you recover.

==== Subversion

Normally reposurgeon will do branch analysis for you.
On most Subversion repositories, and in particular anything with a
standard trunk/tags/branches layout, it will do the right thing. (It
will also cope with adventitious branches in the root directory of the
repo, such as many projects use for website content.)

In very unusual cases you may need to use the "--nobranch"
option. However, this has the disadvantage that you'll have to do the
branch surgery by hand at a later stage. Instead, you may be able to
use the repocutter filter to transform the dump file into a version
shaped right for a regular branch-sensitive lift.

To the author's knowledge, reposurgeon is the only conversion
tool that handles multibranch Subversion repositories in full
generality. It can even translate Subversion commits that alter
multiple branches.

Performance tip: reposurgeon should analyze Subversion repositories at
the rate of over 100K commits per minute, but that rate can fall off
greatly on very large repositories.

Unlike CVS, Subversion repositories have real changesets and the work
in them can effectively always be mapped unto equivalent DVCS commits.
The parent-child relationships among commits will also translate
cleanly.  There is, however, a minor problem around tags, and a
significant problem around merges.

The tag problem arises because Subversion tags are really branches
that you've conventionally agreed not to commit to after the initial
branch copy (that's what the tags/ directory name conveys).  But
Subversion doesn't enforce any prohibition against committing to
the tag branch, and various odd things can happen if you do

The reposurgeon analyzer tries to warn you about pathological cases,
and reposurgeon gives you tools for coping with them.  Unfortunately,
the warnings are (unavoidably) cryptic unless you understand
Subversion internals in detail.

In a DVCS, a merge normally coalesces two entire branches.  Subversion
has something close to this in newer versions; it's called a "sync
merge" working on directories (and is expressed as an svn:mergeinfo
property of the target directory that names the source).  A sync merge
of a branch directory into another branch directory behaves like a
DVCS merge; reposurgeon picks these up and translates them for you.

The older, more basic Subversion merge is per file and is expressed by
per-file svn:mergeinfo properties.  These correspond to what in
DVCS-land are called "cherry-picks", which just replay a commit from a
source branch onto a target branch but do *not* create cross-branch
links.

Sometimes Subversion developers use collections of per-file mergeinfo
properties to express partial branch merges.  This does not map to
the DVCS model at all well, and trying to promote these to full-branch
merges by hand is actually dangerous.  An excellent essay,
http://web.archive.org/web/20170104093332/https://plus.google.com/100357083629018071519/posts/jG7CN9R1SsZ
git merges -- just say no.] explores the problem in depth.  

The bottom line is that reposurgeon warns about per-file svn:mergeinfo
properties _and then discards them_ for good reasons.  If you feel an
urge to hand-edit in a branch merge based on these, do so with care
and check your work.

==== Other VCSes

SCCS: Use http://www.catb.org/esr/sccs2rcs/[sccs2rcs]
to get to RCS, then follow the directions for RCS. There is a script
called sccs2git on CPAN which I don't recommend, as it is poorly
documented and makes no attempt to group commits into changesets.

RCS: reposurgeon will read an RCS collection.  It uses
http://www.catb.org/~esr/cvs-fast-export[cvs-fast-export],
which despite its name does not actually require CVS metadata other than
the RCS master files that store the content.

Mercurial: reposurgeon will read a Mercurial repository. It uses
https://github.com/kilork/hg-git-fast-import[hg-git-fast-import] as an
importer. Note that this conversion is not very well tested yet; you
may want to run conversions with both the importer and the hg
extractor harness and compare them.

Fossil: reposurgeon will read a Fossil repository file. It uses the
native Fossil exporter, which is pretty good but doesn't export ignore
patterns, wiki events, or tickets.

BitKeeper: As of version 7.3 (and probably earlier versions under
open-source licensing) BitKeeper has fast-import and fast-export
subcommands, and reposurgeon now knows how to use these.

Perforce: According to
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31051732/perforce-to-git-migration[this
Stack Overflow answer], the magic incantation is something like `git
p4 clone --import-labels --detect-branches //depot/path/project@all`.
This will create a live Git repository capturing your Perforce
bistory.  This recipe is included for completeness; it is unknown
to te author what (if any) reposurgeon cleanup operations might be
required, but a skim of Perforc documentation suggests that mapping
Perforce user IDs to a Git-style name/address pair will be desirable.

For other systems, see the
https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/InterfacesFrontendsAndTools#Interaction_with_other_Revision_Control_Systems[Git
wiki page on conversion tools].

=== Step Three: Sanity Checking

Before putting in further effort on polishing your conversion
and putting it into production, you should check it for basic
correctness.

Pay attention to error messages emitted during the lift.  Most
of these, and remedial actions to take, are described in the
reposurgeon manual.

For Subversion lifts, use the "headcompare", "tagscompare" and
"branchescompare" productions to compare the converted with the the
unconverted repository.  If you didn't use the cvsconvert wrapper for
your CVS lift, these productions have a similar effect.  Be aware
that these operations may be extremely slow on large Subversion
repositories.

The only differences you should see are those due to keyword expansion
and ignore-file lifting.  If this is not true, you may have found a
serious bug in either reposurgeon or the front end it used, or you
might just have a misassigned tag that can be manually fixed. Consult
http://www.catb.org/~esr/reposurgeon/reporting-bugs.html[How to report
bugs] for information on how to usefully report bugs.

If you are converting from CVS, use reposurgeon's graph command to
examine the conversion, looking (in particular) for misplaced tags or
branch joins. Often these can be manually repaired with little
effort. These flaws do 'not' necessarily imply bugs in cvs-fast-export
or reposurgeon; they may simply indicate previously undetected
malformations in the history. However, reporting them may help improve
cvs-fast-export.

[[cleanup]]
=== Step Four: Cleanup

You should now have a git repository, but it is likely to have a
lot of cruft and conversion artifacts in it.  Here are some common
forms of cruft:

Commit comments and attributions containing non-UTF8 data::
    You could have metadata in your repository in an encoding
    incompatible with UTF-8 (Latin-1 is the ). You will probably want
    to transcode the repo to UTF-8.

Subversion and CVS commit references::
    Often Subversion references will be in the form 'r' followed by a
    string of digits referring to a Subversion commit number. But not
    always; humans come up with lots of ambiguous ways to write these.
    CVS commit references are even harder to spot mechanically, as they're
    just groups of digits separated by dots with no identifying prefix.  A
    clean conversion should turn all these into VCS-independent commit
    references, which will be described later in this document.

Multiline contents with no summary::
    git and hg both encourage comments to begin with a summary line
    that can stand alone as a short description of the change; this
    practice produces more readable output from `git log`
    and `hg log`. For a really high-quality conversion, 
    multiline comments should be edited into this form.

No-fileop commits::
    Commits with no fileops are automatically transformed into tags
    when reading a Subversion repository.  Other importers may generate
    them for various reasons; you can detect them as the =Z visibility
    set. In order to preserve the behavior that read followed by immediate
    write does not modify a stream file, this simplification is not done
    by default in non-Subversion imports.

Branch tip deletes, deletealls, and unexpressed merges::
    In Subversion it is common practice to delete a branch directory
    when that line of development is finished or merged to trunk; this
    makes sense because it reduces the checkout size of the repo in later
    revisions. In a DVCS, deletes at a branch tip don't save you any
    storage, so it makes more sense to leave the branch with all of its
    tip content live if you're not going to delete it entirely. Sometimes
    editing a later commit to have the branch tip as a parent (creating
    a merge that Subversion could not express) make sense; look for
    svn:mergeinfo properties as clues.

Commits generated by *cvs2svn* to carry tag information::
    These lurk in the history of a lot of Subversion projects.
    Sometimes these junk commits are empty (no file operations associated
    with them at all); sometimes they're translated as long lists of
    spurious delete fileops, and sometimes they have actual file content
    (duplicating parent file versions, or referring randomly to file
    versions far older than the junk commit). Older versions of
    `cvs2svn` seem to have generated all kinds of meaningless
    crud into these.

Metadata inserted by git-svn::
    `git-svn` inserts lines at the end of each commit
    comment that refer back to the Subversion commit it is derived from.  This
    is necessary for live-gatewaying, and useful during one-shot
    conversions, but you will probably not want it in the final repo.

Here's a checklist of cleanup steps. If you're using the makefile
generated by repotool, most of these will be done by commands in your
lift script. 

1. Map author IDs from local to DVCS form.

2. Check for leftover cvs2svn junk commits and remove them if possible.

3. Lift references in commit comments.

4. Massage comments into summary-line-plus-continuation form.

5. If the project used the GNU ChangeLog convention, run "changelogs".

6. Remove empty and delete-only tip commits where appropriate.

7. Review generated tags, pruning and fixing locations as appropriate.

8. Look for branch merge points and patch parent marks to make them.

9. Fix up or remove $-keyword cookies in the latest revision.

10. If there's a root branch, check for and remove junk commits on it.

11. Use the transcode command to fix up metadata in non-UTF8 encoding,

12. For the record, make a tag noting time and date of the repo lift.

13. If your target was git, run  `git gc --aggressive`.

Most of the work will be in the comment-fixup and reference-lifting
stages. These normally take only a couple of hours even on very large
repos with thousands of commits. An entire conversion is usually less
than two days of work.

You can use the `authors read` command to perform the
author-ID mapping operation with reposurgeon.

You can find empty commits as the =Z visibility set set and clean
them up with the command `tagify`. Consult the
reposurgeon manual page for usage details.

A good way to spot junk commits is to eyeball the picture of
the commit DAG created by the reposurgeon 'graph' command
- they tend to stand out visually as leaf nodes in odd places. Be
aware that the graph command outputs DOT, the language interpreted by
the http://www.graphviz.org/[graphviz] suite; you will
need a DOT rendering program and an image viewer.

See the documentation of the `references` command; for
details on how fix up Subversion and CVS changeset references in
comments so they're still meaningful.

The command `=L edit` is good for fixing up multiline comments.

The reposurgeon command `inspect =H` will
show you tip commits which may contain only deletes and
deletealls.

Tags can be inspected with `=T inspect`. Junk tags can be removed with
the `delete` command. Tag comments can be modified with `edit`.
Check that the creation date of tags matches what you see in the
source repository; this is the easiest way to spot when one has been
attached to the wrong commit, something that can be manually fixed by
editing its from field.

The command =I will select all commits that don't decode to UTF-8
in both the commit comment and attribution parts.  You eyeball those
to figure out what the encoding is and apply the transcode command
to fix things,

Reposurgeon has a `merge` command specifically for performing branch
merges.  The `edit` command will also allow you to add a parent mark
to a commit.

One minor feature you lose in moving from SCCS, CVS, Subversion, or BitKeeper to a
DVCS is keyword expansion.  You should go through the last revision of
the code and remove $Id$, $Date$, $Revision$, and other keyword
cookies lest they become unhelpful fossils. The full Subversion
set is `$Date:`, `$Revision:`, `$Author:`, `$HeadURL` and `$Id:`. CVS uses
`$Author:`, `$Date:`, `$Header:`, `$Id:`, `$Log:`, `$Revision:`, also (rarely)
`$Locker:`, `$Name:`, `$RCSfile:`, `$Source:`, and `$State:`.
A command like `grep -R '$[A-Z]' .` may be helpful.

After conversion of a branchy repository, look to see if there is a 
'root' branch.  If there are any commits with a sufficiently
pathological structure that reposurgeon can't figure out
what branch they belong to, they'll wind up there.

It's good practice to leave an annotated tag at the conversion point
noting the date and time of the repo lift.  See the next section on
conversion comments for discussion. Here's an example of how to make a tag:

--------
msgin --create <<EOF
Tag-Name: git-conversion

Marks the spot at which this repository was converted from Subversion to git.

Conversion notes are enclosed in double square brackets. Junk commits
generated by cvs2svn have been removed, commit references have been
mapped into a uniform VCS-independent syntax, and some comments edited
into summary-plus-continuation form.
EOF
--------

Experiments with reposurgeon suggest that `git
import` doesn't try to pack or otherwise optimize for space when
it populates a repo from a dump file; this produces large
repositories.  Running `git repack` and `git gc
--aggressive` can slim them down quite a lot.

[[conversion-comments]]
==== Conversion comments

Sometimes, in converting a repository, you may need to insert an
explanatory comment - for example, if metadata has been garbled or
missing and you need to point to that fact.

It's helpful for repository-browsing tools if there is a uniform
syntax for this that is highly unlikely to show up in repository
comments.  I recommend enclosing translation notes in [[ ]].  This 
has the advantage of being visually similar to the [ ] traditionally
used for editorial comments in text.

It is good practice to include, in either the root commit of the
repository or the conversion tag, a note dating and attributing the
conversion work and explaining these conventions.  Example:

------------------------------------------------------------------
[[This repository was converted from Subversion to git on 2012-10-24
by Eric S. Raymond &lt;esr@thyrsus.com&gt;.  Here and elsewhere, conversion
notes are enclosed in double square brackets. Junk commits generated
by cvs2svn have been removed, commit references have been mapped into
a uniform VCS-independent syntax, and some comments edited into
summary-plus-continuation form.]]
------------------------------------------------------------------

You should also, as previously noted, leave a tag in the normal
commit sequence noting the switchover.  You can do this with
the `msgin --create` command; see the reposurgeon
manual page for details and an example.

[[nonsurgical]]
==== Nonsurgical cleanup steps

A step that too often gets missed and then inelegantly patched in
later is converting the declarations that tell the version-control
system to ignore derived files. reposurgeon does this for
you if you're using it for CVS- or Subversion-to-git conversion, both
expressing Subversion svn:ignore properties as .gitignore files 
and lifting .cvsignore files to .gitignore files; see the
http://www.catb.org/~esr/reposurgeon/reposurgeon.html#limitations[LIMITATIONS
AND GUARANTEES section on its manpage] if other DVCSes are
involved.

Any .gitignore files found in a repository were almost ceryainly
created by git-svn users ad hoc and should be discarded; it is up to
the human doing the conversion to look through them and rescue any
ignore patterns that should be merged into the converted repository.
This behavior can be reversed with the --user-ignores option, which
simply passes through .gitignore files.

[[recovering]]
==== Recovering from errors

Occasionally you'll discover problems with a conversion after you've
pushed it to a project's hosting site, typically to a bare repo that
the hosting software created for you.  Here's how to cope:

1. Do your surgery on a copy of the repo with its .git/config
pointing to the public location.

2. Warn the public repo's users that it is briefly going out 
of service and they will need to re-clone it afterwards!

3. Ensure that it is possible to force-push to the repository.
How you do this will vary depending on your hosting site.

4. On gitlab.com, under Settings, there is a "Protected Branches"
item you can use. If you unprotect a branch, you can force-push to it.
+
Elsewhere, you may be able to re-initialize the public repo (this
works, for example, on SourceForge). You'll need ssh access to the
bare repo directory on the host - let's suppose it's 'myproject'. Pop
up to the enclosing directory and do this:
+
........................................................................
    mv myproject myproject-hidden
    rm -fr myproject-hidden/*
    git init --bare myproject-hidden
    mv myproject-hidden myproject
........................................................................
+
The point of doing it this way is (a) so you never actually remove
myproject (on many hosts you will not have create permissions in the
enclosing directory), and (b) so no user can update the repo while 
you're clearing it (mv is atomic).
+
Here's a script that will do the job on SourceForge:
+
........................................................................
#!/usr/bin/expect -f
#
# nuke - nuke a SourceForge repo
#
# usage: nuke project [userid]
#

if {$argc < 1} {
    puts "nuke: project name argument is required"
    exit 1
} else {
    set project [lindex $argv 0]
    set user $env(USER)
    if {$argc >= 2} {
	set user [lindex $argv 1]
    }
}

set remoteprompt "bash-4.1"

set timeout -1
spawn $env(SHELL)
match_max 100000
send -- "ssh -t $user@shell.sourceforge.net create"
expect -exact "ssh -t $user@shell.sourceforge.net \r create"
send -- "\r"
expect -exact "$remoteprompt\$ "
send -- "cd /home/git/p/$project\n"
expect -exact "$remoteprompt\$ "
send -- "cd git-main.git\n"
expect -exact "$remoteprompt\$ "
send -- "rm -fr *\n"
expect -exact "$remoteprompt\$ "
send -- "git init --bare .\n"
expect -exact "$remoteprompt\$ "
........................................................................
+
After re-initializing, you should be able to run `git
push` to push the new history up to the public repo.

5. From your modified local repo, try 
+
........................................................................
     git push --mirror --force
........................................................................
+
to push the new history up to the public repo.

6. Inform the public repo's users that it is available and remind
them that they will need to re-clone it.

=== Step Five: Client Tools

Developers who are already git fans and know how to use a git
client will, of course, have no particular trouble using a git
repository.

Windows users accustomed to working through TortoiseSVN can move to
https://tortoisegit.org/[TortoiseGIT].

Developers who like hg can use the https://hg-git.github.com/[hg-git
mercurial plugin]. There is an Ubuntu package "mercurial-git" for
this, and other distributions are likely to carry it as well. It
installs a Mercurial plugin called hg-git.

There are some hg-git limitations to be aware of. In order to
simulate git behavior, hg-git keeps some local state in the .hg
directories; a map from git branch names to Mercurial commits, a list
of Mercurial bookmarks describing git branches (which have
bookmark-like behavior different from a Mercurial named branch) and a
file mapping git SHA1 hashes to hg SHA1 hashes (both systems use them
as commit IDs).  The problem is that hg doesn't copy any of this local
state when it clones a repo, so clones of hg-git repos lose their
git branches and tags.

If you have developers attached to the CVS interface, it is possible
(and in fact relatively easy) to set up a gateway interface that lets
them continue using their CVS client tools.  Consult the documentation
for
https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-cvsserver.html[git-cvsserver].

=== Step Six: Good Practice

Educate your developers in the following good practices:

==== Commit references

The combination of a committer email address with a ISO8601
timestamp is a good way to refer to a commit without being
VCS-specific.  Thus, instead of "commit 304a53c2", use
"<2011-10-25T15:11:09Z!fred@foonly.com>". I recommend that you _not
vary from this format_, even in trivial ways like omitting the 'Z'
or changing the 'T' or '!'. Making these cookies uniform and
machine-parseable will have good consequences for future
repository-browsing tools. The reference-lifting code in
reposurgeon generates them.

Being careful about this has an additional benefit.  Someday your
project may need to change VCSes yet again; on that day, it will be
extremely helpful if nobody has to try to convert years' or decades' 
worth of VCS-specific magic cookies in the history.

Sometimes it's enough to quote the summary line of a commit. So,
instead of "Back out most of commit 304a53c2", you might write 
"Back out Attempted divide-by-zero fix.".

When appropriate, "my last commit" is simple and effective.

==== Comment summary lines

As previously noted, git and hg both want comments to begin with a
summary line that can stand alone as a short description of the
change; this may optionally be followed by a separating blank line
and details in whatever form the commenter likes.

Try to end summary lines with a period.  Ending punctuation other
than a period should be used to indicate that the summary line is
incomplete and continues after the separator; "..." is conventional.

For best results, stay within 72 characters per line.  Don't go
over 80.

Good comment practice produces more readable output from `git
log` and `hg log`, and makes it easy to take in
whole sequences of changes at a glance.

[[theory]]
== Theory of Operation

[[outside]]
=== The outside view

As the quick-start example shows, you're typically going to do three
steps when you use reposurgeon: (1) read in one (or more)
repositories, (2) do surgical things on them, and (3) write out one
(or more) repositories.

To keep reposurgeon simple and flexible, it normally does not do its
own repository reading and writing.  Instead, it relies on being able
to parse and emit the command streams created by git-fast-export and
read by git-fast-import.  This means that it can be used on any
version-control system that has both fast-export and fast-import
utilities. The git-import stream format also implicitly defines a
common language of primitive operations for reposurgeon to speak.

In order to deal with version-control systems that do not have
fast-export equivalents, reposurgeon can also host extractor code that
reads repositories directly.  For each version-control system
supported through an extractor, reposurgeon uses a small amount of
knowledge about the system's command-line tools to (in effect) replay
repository history into an input stream internally. Repositories under
systems supported through extractors can be read by reposurgeon, but
not modified by it.  In particular, reposurgeon can be used to move a
repository history from any VCS supported by an extractor to any VCS
supported by a normal importer/exporter pair.

Mercurial repository reading is implemented with an extractor
class; writing is handled with the stock "hg fastimport" command.  A
test extractor exists for git, but is normally disabled in favor of
the regular exporter.

Subversion is an important exception.  Its exporter is '```svnadmin
dump```', which doesn't ship a git-fast-import stream, but rather the
unique dump format supported by Subversion. Reposurgeon contains
an interpreter for this stream format.

As a matter of historical interest, some old versions of reposurgeon
had tha ability to build a Subversion repository on output by
synthesizing a Subversion dump stream and feeding it to '```svnadmin
load```'.  This feature was a cute stunt, but was abandoned during
translation to Go for a couple of different reasons. Most importantly,
there is zero demand for moving histories *to* Subversion - and
supposing there were, moving content and metdate fom git's DAG
representation to a Subversion stream is very lossy. Subversion to Git
to Subversion wouldn't even have round-tripped well.

[[inside]]
=== The inside view

Between reads and writes, reposurgeon can usefully be thought of as
a structure editor for directed acyclic graphs with a pre-defined set of
attributes on their nodes.

To get a feel for what that graph is like, it's helpful to have seen a
git-fast-import stream file.  Here is a trivial example from the
reposurgeon testv suite, describing a history with a two commit to a
single file:

--------
blob
mark :1
data 20
1234567890123456789

commit refs/heads/master
mark :2
committer Ralf Schlatterbeck <rsc@runtux.com> 0 +0000
data 14
First commit.
M 100644 :1 README

blob
mark :3
data 20
0123456789012345678

commit refs/heads/master
mark :4
committer Ralf Schlatterbeck <rsc@runtux.com> 10 +0000
data 15
Second commit.
from :2
M 100644 :3 README

--------

A git-fast-import stream consists of a sequence of commands
which must be executed in the specified sequence to build the repo; to
avoid confusion with reposurgeon commands
we will refer to the stream commands as _events_ in
this documentation.  These events are implicitly numbered from 1
upwards.  Most commands require specifying a selection of event
sequence numbers so reposurgeon will know
which events to modify or delete.

For all the details of event types and semantics, see the
git-fast-import(1) manual page; the rest of this paragraph is a quick
start for the impatient. The most prominent events in a stream are
*commits* describing revision states of the repository; these group
together under a single change comment one or more *fileops* (file
operations), which usually point to *blobs* that are revision states
of individual files. A fileop may also be a delete operation
indicating that a specified previously-existing file was deleted as
part of the version commit; there are a couple of other special fileop
types of lesser importance.

Reposurgeon's internal representation of a repository history is
basically a deserialized git fast-omport stream.  A few extra
attributes are supported; most notavly, commits and resets have a
legacy-id attribute that carries over the object's ID from whatever
version-control system exported the stream, in particular a Subversion
or CVS revision number.

[[interpreter]]
=== The interpreter view

The program can be run in one of two modes, either as an
interactive command interpreter or in batch mode to execute commands
given as arguments on the reposurgeon invocation
line.

The only differences between these modes are (1) the interactive one
begins by turning on the '```interactive```' option, (2) in batch mode
all errors (including normally recoverable errors in selection-set
syntax) are fatal, and (3) each command-line argument beginning with
'```--```' has that stripped off (which in particular means that
`--help` and `--version` will work as expected).

Also, in interactive mode, Ctrl-P and Ctrl-N will be available to
scroll through your command history and tab completion of both command
keywords and name arguments (wherever that makes semantic sense) is
available.

It is expected that interactive mode will be used mainly for exploring
repository metadata, while conversion experiments will be captured in
a script that is gradually improved until the day final cutover
can be performed and the old repository decommissioned.

Note that this means the old repository can be left in service
while the conversion recipe is under development. Recipe 
development should be treated as a serious project with its
own change tracking.

[[wayfinding]]
== Finding your way around

In the remainder of this documewnt, imdividual commands are described
by ganging paragraphs led by the command sequence.

Help is always available.

`help`::
   Get help on the interpreter commands. Optionally follow with
   whitespace and a command name; with no argument, lists all commands. '?'
   also invokes this.

History is always available.

`history`::
   List the commands you have entered this session.

You can do Ctrl-P or up-arrow to scroll back through the command
history list, and Ctrl-N or down-arrow to scroll forwad in it.

Tab-completion on command keywords is available.

You don't need to exit the interpreter to run quick shall commands.

`shell`::
   Execute the shell command given in the remainder of the line.
   '!' also invokes this.

[[general]]
== General command syntax

Commands to reposurgeon consist of a command keyword, sometimes
preceded by a selection set, sometimes followed by
whitespace-separated arguments. It is often possible to omit the
selection-set argument and have it default to something reasonable.

Here are some motivating examples.  The commands will be
explained in more detail after the description of selection
syntax.

--------

The regular expressions should be in
https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax[Golang's] format, with one
exception. Due to a conflict with the use of $ for arguments in the
script command, we retain Python's use of backslashes as a leader for
references to group matches.

Regular expressions are not anchored.  Use ^ and $ to anchor them
to the beginning or end of the search space, when appropriate.

[[selections]]
=== Selection syntax

A selection set is ordered; that is, any given element may occur
only one, and the set is ordered by when its members were first added.

The selection-set specification syntax is an expression-oriented
minilanguage.  The most basic term in this language is a
location. The following sorts of primitive locations
are supported:

event numbers::
   A plain numeric literal is interpreted as a 1-origin
   event-sequence number.

marks::
   A numeric literal preceded by a colon is interpreted
   as a mark; see the import stream format documentation for explanation
   of the semantics of marks.

tag and branch names::
   The basename of a branch (including branches in the refs/tags
   namespace) refers to its tip commit.  The name of a tag is equivalent
   to its mark (that of the tag itself, not the commit it refers to). Tag
   and branch locations are bracketed with `<` `>` (angle brackets) to
   distinguish them from command keywords.

legacy IDs::
   If the contents of name brackets (`< >`) does not match a tag or
   branch name, the interpreter next searches legacy IDs of commits.  This
   is especially useful when you have imported a Subversion dump; it
   means that commits made from it can be referred to by their corresponding
   Subversion revision numbers.

commit numbers::
   A numeric literal within name brackets (`< >`)
   preceded by `#` is interpreted as a 1-origin
   commit-sequence number.

reset@ names::
   A name with the prefix '```reset@```' refers to the latest reset with a
   basename matching the part after the `@`. Usually there is only one such
   reset.

$::
   Refers to the last event.

These may be grouped into sets in the following ways:

ranges::
   A range is two locations separated by '```..```', and is
   the set of events beginning at the left-hand location and ending at the
   right-hand location (inclusive).

lists::
   Comma-separated lists of locations and ranges are
   accepted, with the obvious meaning.

There are some other ways to construct event sets:

visibility sets::
   A visibility set is an expression specifying a set of event
   types. It will consist of a leading equal sign, followed by type
   letters. These are the type letters:
+
[options=""]
|===================================================================
| B | blobs                           | Most default selection sets exclude
blobs; they have to be manipulated through the commits they are attached to.
| C | commits                         |
| D | all-delete commits              | These are artifacts produced by some
older repository-conversion tools.
| H | head (branch tip) commits       |
| O | orphaned (parentless) commits   |
| U | commits with callout parents    |
| Z | commits with no fileops         |
| M | merge (multi-parent) commits    |
| F | fork (multi-child) commits      |
| L | commits with unclean multi-line comments |  E.g. without a separating
empty line after the first
| I | commits for which metadata cannot be decoded to UTF-8 |
| T | tags                            |
| R | resets                          |
| P | passthroughs                    | All event types simply passed through,
including comments, `progress`commands,
and `checkpoint` commands
| N | Legacy IDs                      | Any comment matching a cookie
(legacy-ID) format.
|===================================================================

references::
   A reference name (bracketed by angle brackets) resolves
   to a single object, either a commit or tag.
+
[options="header"]
|===================================================================
| type          | interpretation
| tag name      | annotated tag with that name
| branch name   | the branch tip commit
| legacy ID     | commit with that legacy ID
| assigned name | name equated to a selection by assign
|===================================================================
+
Note that if an annotated tag and a branch have the same name foo,
`<foo>` will resolve to the tag rather than the branch tip commit.

dates and action stamps::
   A date or action stamp in angle brackets resolves
   to a selection set of all matching commits.
+
[options="header"]
|===================================================================
| type                           | interpretation
| RFC3339 timestamp              | commit or tag with that time/date
| action stamp (timestamp!email) | commits or tags with that timestamp and
author (or committer if no author). Aliases of the author are also accepted.
| yyyy-mm-dd part of RFC3339 timestamp | all commits and tags with that date
|===================================================================
+
To refine the match to a single commit, use a 1-origin index
suffix separated by `#`. Thus `<2000-02-06T09:35:10Z>` can
match multiple commits, but `<2000-02-06T09:35:10Z#2>` matches
only the second in the set.

text search::
    A text search expression is a regular expression
    surrounded by forward slashes (to embed a forward slash in it, use a
    C-like string escape such as `\x2f`).
+
A text search normally matches against the comment fields of commits and
annotated tags, or against their author/committer names, or against
the names of tags; also the text of passthrough objects.
+
The scope of a text search can be changed with qualifier
letters after the trailing slash.  These are as follows:
+
[options="header"]
|===================================================================
| letter   | interpretation
| a        | author name in commit
| b        | branch name in commit; also matches blobs referenced by commits
on matching branches, and tags which point to commits on matching branches.
| c        | comment text of commit or tag
| r        | committish reference in tag or reset
| p        | text in passthrough
| t        | tagger in tag
| n        | name of tag
| B        | blob content
|===================================================================
+
Multiple qualifier letters can add more search scopes.
+
(The "b" qualifier replaces the branchset syntax
in earlier versions of reposurgeon.)

paths::
   A "path expression" enclosed in square brackets resolves to the
   set of all commits and blobs related to a path matching the given
   expression. The path expression itself is either a path literal or a
   regular expression surrounded by slashes. Immediately after the
   trailing / of a path regexp you can put any number of the following
   characters which act as flags: '```a```', '```c```', '```D```', '```M```',
   '```R```', '```C```', '```N```'.
+
By default, a path is related to a commit if the latter has a
fileop that touches that file path - modifies that change it, deletes
that remove it, renames and copies that have it as a source or
target. When the '```c```' flag is in use the meaning changes: the paths
related to a commit become all paths that would be present in a
checkout for that commit.
+
A path literal matches a commit if and only if the path literal is
exactly one of the paths related to the commit (no prefix or suffix operation
is done). In particular a path literal won't match if it corresponds to a
directory in the chosen repository.
+
A regular expression matches a commit if it matches any path related to
the commit anywhere in the path. You can use `^` or `$` if you want the
expression to only match at the beginning or end of paths.  When the '```a```'
flag is in use, the path expression selects commits whose every path matches the
regular expression. This is necessarily a subset of commits selected without the
'```a```'
flag because it also selects commits with no related paths (e.g. empty commits,
deletealls and commits with empty trees). If you want to avoid those, you can
use e.g. '```[/regex/] & [/regex/a]```'.
+
The flags '```D```', '```M```', '```R```', '```C```', '```N```' restrict match
checking to the corresponding fileop types.  Note that this means an '```a```'
match is
easier (not harder) to achieve.  These are no-ops when used with '```c```'.
+
A path or literal matches a blob if it matches any path that
appeared in a modification fileop that referred to that blob. To
select purely matching blobs or matching commits, compose a path
expression with `=B` or `=C`.
+
If you need to embed '```[^/]```' into your regular expression (e.g. to
express "all characters but a slash") you can use a C-like string
escape such as `\x2f`.

function calls::
   The expression language has named special functions.  The sequence for
   a named function is "```@```" followed by a function name,
   followed by an argument in parentheses. Presently the following
   functions are defined:
+
[options="header"]
|===================================================================
| name   | interpretation
| `min`  | minimum member of a selection set
| `max`  | maximum member of a selection set
| `amp`  | nonempty selection set becomes all objects,
empty set is returned empty
| `par`  | all parents of commits in the argument set
| `chn`  | all children of commits in the argument set
| `dsc`  | all commits descended from the argument set
(argument set included)
| `anc`  | all commits whom the argument set is descended from
(argument set included)
| `pre`  | events before the argument set;
empty if the argument set includes the first event.
| `suc`  | events after the argument set;
empty if the argument set includes the last event.
| `srt`  | sort the argument set by event number.
|===================================================================

Set expressions may be combined with the operators '```|```' and '```&```'
which are, respectively, set union and intersection. The `|` has lower
precedence than intersection, but you may use parentheses '```(```' and
'```)```' to group expressions in case there is ambiguity (this replaces the
curly brackets used in older versions of the syntax).

Any set operation may be followed by '```?```' to add the set
members' neighbors and referents.  This extends the set to include the
parents and children of all commits in the set, and the referents of
any tags and resets in the set. Each blob reference in the set is
replaced by all commit events that refer to it. The `?` can be repeated
to extend the neighborhood depth.  The result of a `?` extension is
sorted so the result is in ascending order.

Do set negation with prefix '```~```'; it has higher precedence than
`&` and `|` but lower than `?`.

[[command-syntax]]
=== Command syntax

Following the (optional) selection set will be one 
a whitespace-separated command name, possibly another
whitespace-separated subcommand name, and possibly
following arguments.

The syntax of following arguments is variable according to the
requrements of individual commands, but there are a couple of general
rules.

* You can have comments in a script, let by the character "#".  Both
  whole-line and "winged" comments following command arguments are
  suppotrted.  Note that reposurgeon's command paeser is fairly
  primitive and will be confused by a literal # in a command argument.

* Many commands interpret C/Go style backslash escapes like \n in
  arguments.  You can usually, for example, get around having to
  include a literal # in an argument by writing `\x23`.

* Some commands support option flags.  These are led with a --, so if
  there is an option flag named "foo" you would write it as "--foo".
  Option flags are parsed out of the command line before any other
  interpretation is performed, and can be anywhwere on the line.  The
  order of option flags is never significant.

* When an option flag "foo" sets a value, the sayntax is --foo=xxx
  with no spaces around the equal sign.

* All commands that expect data to be presented on standard input support
  input redirection.  You may write "<myfile" to take input from the
  file named "myfile".  Reirectioons are parsed out early, before
  the command arguments proprt arte interpreted, and can be anywhere
  on the line

* All commands that expect data to be presented on standard input also
  accept a here-document, just lthe shell syntax for here-documents
  with a leading "<<". There are two here-documents in the quick-start
  example.

* Most commands that normally ship data to standard output accept
  output redirection.  As in the shell, you can weite ">outfile" to
  send the command output to "outfile", and ">>outfile2" to append
  to outfile2.

* Some commands take following arguments that are regular
  expressions. In this context, they still require start and end
  delimiters as they do when used in a selection prefix, but if you
  need to have a / in the expression the delimiters can be any
  printable character.  As a reminder, these are described in the
  embedded help as "delimited" regular expressions.

* Also note that following-argument regular expressions may not contain
  whitespace; if you need to specify whitespace or a non-printable
  character use a standard C-style escape such as `\s` for space.

Beware that while the reposurgeon CLI mimics simple shell features
like redirection, many things you can do in a real shell won't work.
String-quoting arguments will fail.  You can't redirect standard
error (but see the '```log```' command for a rough equivalent). And
you can't pipe input from a command or output to a command.

In general you should avoid getting cute with the command parser.
It's stupider than it looks.

[[import-export]]
== Import and Export

reposurgeon can hold multiple repository states in core.  Each has a
name.  At any given time, one may be selected for editing. Commands in
this group import repositories, export them, and manipulate the
in-core list and the selection.

If you are planning a conversion from Subversion, yout should
probably read <<subversion>> after this section.

If you are planning a conversion from Mercurial, yout should
probably read <<mercurial>> after this section.

=== Reading and writing repositories

`read` [ `--format=fossil` ] [ `--no-implicit` ] [ _directory_ | `-` | <__infile__ ]::
    With a directory-name argument, this command attempts
    to read in the contents of a repository in any supported
    version-control system under that directory; read with no arguments
    does this in the current directory. If output is redirected to a
    plain file, it will be read in as a fast-import stream or Subversion
    dumpfile. With an argument of '```-```', this command reads a
    fast-import stream or Subversion dumpfile from standard input (this
    will be useful in filters constructed with command-line
    arguments).
+
If the contents is a fast-import stream, any "```cvs-revision```" property
on a commit is taken to be a newline-separated list of CVS revision cookies
pointing to the commit, and used for reference lifting.
+
If the contents is a fast-import stream, any "```legacy-id```" property
on a commit is taken to be a legacy ID token pointing to the commit,
and used for reference-lifting.
+
If the read location is a git repository and contains a
_.git/cvsauthors_ file (such as is left in place
by '```git cvsimport -A```') that file will be read in as
if it had been given to the '```authors read```' command.
+
If the read location is a directory, and its repository
subdirectory has a file named _legacy-map_, that file
will be read as though passed to a '```legacy read```'
command.
+
If the read location is a file and the `--format=fossil` option
is used, the file is interpreted as a Fossil repository.
+
The just-read-in repo is added to the list of loaded
repositories and becomes the current one, selected for surgery. If it
was read from a plain file and the file name ends with one of the
extensions '```.fi```' or '```.svn```', that
extension is removed from the load list name.
+
Normally, missing '```from```' links in input streams are defaulted to the
previous commit.  The `--no-implicit` option disables this and may
enable round-tripping of some streams on which it would fail (note
however that `git fast-export` generates explicit '```from```' links). This
option will mainly be useful for testing and debugging.
+
Note: this command does not take a selection set.

`write` [ `--legacy` ] [ `--format=fossil` ] [ `--noincremental` ] [ `--callout` ] [ >__outfile__ | `-` ]::
   Dump selected events as a fast-import stream representing the
   edited repository; the default selection set is all events. Where to
   dump to is standard output if there is no argument or the argument is
   '```-```', or the target of an output redirect. 
+
Alternatively, if there is no redirect and the argument names a
directory, the repository is rebuilt into that directory, with any
selection set being ignored; if that target directory is nonempty its
contents are backed up to a save directory.
+
If the write location is a file and the
`--format=fossil` option is used, the file is written in
Fossil repository format.
+
With the `--legacy` option, the Legacy-ID of
each commit is appended to its commit comment at write time. This
option is mainly useful for debugging conversion edge cases.
+
If you specify a partial selection set such that some commits
are included but their parents are not, the output will include
incremental dump cookies for each branch with an origin outside the
selection set, just before the first reference to that branch in a
commit.  An incremental dump cookie looks like "```refs/heads/foo^0```" and
is a clue to export-stream loaders that the branch should be glued to
the tip of a pre-existing branch of the same name.  The
`--noincremental` option suppresses this behavior.
+
When you specify a partial selection set, including a commit
object forces the inclusion of every blob to which it refers and
every tag that refers to it.
+
Specifying a partial selection may cause a situation in which
some parent marks in merges don't correspond to commits present in the
dump.  When this happens and `--callout` option was
specified, the write code replaces the merge mark with a callout, the
action stamp of the parent commit; otherwise the parent mark is
omitted.  Importers will fail when reading a stream dump with callouts;
it is intended to be used by the '```graft```'
command.
+
Specifying a write selection set with gaps in it is allowed
but unlikely to lead to good results if it is loaded by an importer.
+
Property extensions will be be omitted from the output if the
importer for the preferred repository type cannot digest them.
+
Note: to examine small groups of commits without the progress
meter, use '```inspect```'.

[[preferences]]
=== Repository type preference

`prefer` [ _repotype_ ]::
   With no arguments, describe capabilities of all supported
   systems. With an argument (which must be the name of a supported
   system) this has two effects:
+
First, if there are multiple repositories in a
directory you do a read on, reposurgeon will read the preferred one
(otherwise it will complain that it can't choose among them).
+
Secondly, this will change reposurgeon's preferred type for output.
This means that you do a write to a directory, it will build a repo of
the preferred type rather than its original type (if it had one).
+
If no preferred type has been explicitly selected, reading in a
repository (but not a fast-import stream) will implicitly set the
preferred type to the type of that repository.
+
In older versions of reposurgeon this
command changed the type of the selected repository, if there is one.
That behavior interacted badly with attempts to interpret legacy IDs
and has been removed.

`sourcetype` [ _repotype_ ]::
   Report (with no arguments) or select (with one argument) the current
   repository's source type.  This type is normally set at
   repository-read time, but may remain unset if the source was a stream
   file.
+
The source type affects the interpretation of legacy IDs (for
purposes of the `=N` visibility set and the '```references```' command) by
controlling the regular expressions used to recognize them. If no
preferred output type has been set, it may also change the output
format of stream files made from the repository.
+
The source type is reliably set whenever a live repository is read, or
when a Subversion stream or Fossil dump is interpreted but not
necessarily by other stream files. Streams generated by
cvs-fast-export(1) using the `--reposurgeon` option are detected as CVS. In
some other cases, the source system is detected from the presence of
magic $-headers in contents blobs.

[[rebuild]]
=== Rebuilds in place

reposurgeon can rebuild an altered repository
in place.  Untracked files are normally saved and restored when the
contents of the new repository is checked out (but see the
documentation of the '```preserve```' command for a
caveat).

`rebuild` [ _directory_ ]::
   Rebuild a repository from the state held by
   reposurgeon.  This command does not take a
   selection set.
+
The single argument, if present, specifies the target directory in
which to do the rebuild; if the repository read was from a repo
directory (and not a git-import stream), it defaults to that
directory.  If the target directory is nonempty its contents are
backed up to a save directory.  Files and directories on the
repository's _preserve list_ are copied back from the backup directory
after repo rebuild. The default preserve list depends on the
repository type, and can be displayed with the '```stats```' command.
+
If reposurgeon has a nonempty legacy map,
it will be written to a file named _legacy-map_
in the repository subdirectory as though by a
'```legacy write```' command. (This will normally
be the case for Subversion and CVS conversions.)

[[recovery]]
=== Crash recovery

This section will become relevant only if `reposurgeon` or something
underneath it in the software and hardware stack crashes while in the
middle of writing out a repository, in particular if the target
directory of the rebuild is your current directory.

The tool has two conflicting objectives. On the one hand, we
never want to risk clobbering a pre-existing repo.  On the other hand,
we want to be able to run this tool in a directory with a repo and
modify it in place.

We resolve this dilemma by playing a game of three-directory monte.

. First, we build the repo in a freshly-created staging
directory.  If your target directory is named
`/path/to/foo`, the staging directory will be a
peer named `/path/to/foo-stageNNNN`, where NNNN is
a cookie derived from reposurgeon's process
ID.

. We then make an empty backup directory.  This directory will
be named `+/path/to/foo.~N~+`, where _N_ is incremented
so as not to conflict with any existing backup directories.
reposurgeon never, under any circumstances,
ever deletes a backup directory.
+
So far, all operations are safe; the worst that can happen up to
this point if the process gets interrupted is that the staging and
backup directories get left behind.

. The critical region begins. We first move everything in the
target directory to the backup directory.

. Then we move everything in the staging directory to the
target.

.  We finish off by restoring untracked files in the target
directory from the backup directory. That ends the critical
region.

During the critical region, all signals that can be ignored are
ignored.

[[preservation]]
=== File preservation

When the repository type you are working with has a "lister" method,
it can tell which files in a repository directory arte not checked in
and will copy them into the edited repository made by a rebuild.

The following commands are required only if there is no lister
method and you have to set presrrvations by hand.

`preserve` [ _file..._ ]::
   Add (presumably untracked) files or directories to the repo's
   list of paths to be restored from the backup directory after a
   '```rebuild```'. Each argument, if any, is interpreted as a
   pathname.  The current preserve list is displayed afterwards.
+
It is only necessary to use this feature if your version-control
system lacks a command to list files under version control. Under
systems with such a command (which include git and hg), all files that
are neither beneath the repository dot directory nor under reposurgeon
temporary directories are preserved automatically.

`unpreserve` [ _file..._ ]::
   Remove (presumably untracked) files or directories to
   the repo's list of paths to be restored from the backup directory
   after a '```rebuild```'. Each argument, if any, is
   interpreted as a pathname.  The current preserve list is displayed
   afterwards.

[[tarballs]]
=== Incorporating release tarballs

When converting a legacy repository, it sometimes happens that
there are archived releases of the project surviving from before the
date of the repository's  initial commit.  It may be desirable to
insert those releases at the front of the repository history.

To do this, use the '```incorporate```' command.  This
inserts the contents of specified tarballs as commits.  The tarball
names are given as arguments; if no arguments, a list is read from
stdin.  Tarballs may be gzipped or bzipped.  The initial segment of
each path is assumed to be a version directory and stripped off.  The
number of segments stripped off can be set with the option
`--strip=<n>`, _n_ defaulting to 1.

Takes a singleton selection set.  Normally inserts before that commit; with
the option `--after`, insert after it.  The default selection set is the very
first commit of the repository.

The option `--date` can be used to set the commit date. It takes an argument,
which is expected to be an RFC3339 timestamp.

The generated commits have a committer field (the invoking user) and
each gets as date the modification time of the newest file in
the tarball (not the mod time of the tarball itself). No author field
is generated.  A comment recording the tarball name is generated.

Note that the import stream generated by this command is - while correct -
not optimal, and may in particular contain duplicate blobs.

With the `--firewall` option, generate an additional commit after the
sequence consisting only of deletes crafted to prevent the incorporated
content from leaking forward.

[[lists]]
=== The repository list

Reposurgeon can have several repositories loaded at once.
The following commands operae on the repository list.

`choose` [ _reponame_ ]::
   Choose a named repo on which to operate.  The name of a repo is
   normally the basename of the directory or file it was loaded from, but
   repos loaded from standard input are "unnamed".
   reposurgeon will add a disambiguating
   suffix if there have been multiple reads from the same source.
+
With no argument, lists the names of the currently stored
repositories and their load times.  The second column is '```*```' for the
currently selected repository, '```-```' for others.

`drop` [ _reponame_ ]::
   Drop a repo named by the argument from reposurgeon's list,
   freeing the memory used for its metadata and deleting on-disk
   blobs. With no argument, drops the currently chosen repo.

`rename` _reponame_::
   Rename the currently chosen repo; requires an argument.  Won't
   do it if there is already one by the new name.

[[information]]
== Information and reports

Commands in this group report information about the selected
repository.

The output of these commands can individually be redirected to
a named output file. Where indicated in the syntax, you can prefix the
output filename with '```>```' and give it as a following
argument.  If you use '```>>```' the file is opened
for append rather than write.

[[reports]]
=== Reports on the DAG

`list` [ >__outfile__ ]::
   This is the main command for identifying the events
   you want to modify.  It lists commits in the selection set by event
   sequence number with summary information. The first column is raw
   event numbers, the second a timestamp in local time. If the repository
   has legacy IDs, they will be displayed in the third column. The
   leading portion of the comment follows.

`index` [ >__outfile__ ]::
   Display four columns of info on objects in the selection set:
   their number, their type, the associate mark (or '```-```' if no mark) and a
   summary field varying by type.  For a branch or tag it's the
   reference; for a commit it's the commit branch; for a blob it's the
   repository path of the file in the blob.

`stamp` [ >__outfile__ ]::
   Alternative form of listing that displays full action
   stamps, usable as references in selections.

`tip` [ >__outfile__ ]::
   Display the branch tip names associated with commits
   in the selection set.  These will not necessarily be the same as their
   branch fields (which will often be tag names if the repo contains
   either annotated or lightweight tags).
+
If a commit is at a branch tip, its tip is its branch name.  If
it has only one child, its tip is the child's tip.  If it has multiple
children, then if there is a child with a matching branch name its tip
is the child's tip.  Otherwise this function throws a recoverable
error.

`tags` [>__outfile__ ]::
   Display tags and resets: three fields, an event number and a type and a name.
   Branch tip commits associated with tags are also displayed with the type
   field '```commit```'.

`inspect` [>__outfile__ ]::
   Dump a fast-import stream representing selected events to standard
   output.  Just like a write, except (1) the progress meter is disabled,
   and (2) there is an identifying header before each event dump.

`graph` [>__outfile__ ]::
   Emit a visualization of the commit graph in the DOT markup language
   used by the graphviz tool suite.  This can be fed as input to the main
   graphviz rendering program dot(1), which will yield a viewable
   image.
+
You may find a script like this useful:
+
----
graph $1 >/tmp/foo$$
shell dot </tmp/foo$$ -Tpng | display -; rm /tmp/foo$$
----
+
You can substitute in your own preferred image viewer, of course.

`lint` [ options ] [>__outfile__ ]::
   Look for DAG and metadata configurations that may indicate a
   problem. Presently checks for: (1) Mid-branch deletes, (2)
   disconnected commits, (3) parentless commits, (4) the existence of
   multiple roots, (5) committer and author IDs that don't look
   well-formed as DVCS IDs, (6) multiple child links with identical
   branch labels descending from the same commit, (7) time and
   action-stamp collisions.
+
Options to issue only partial reports are supported; '```lint
--options```' or '```lint -?```' lists them.
+
The options and output format of this command are unstable; they may
change without notice as more sanity checks are added.

[[statistics]]
=== Statistics

`stats` [ __repo-name__...] [>__outfile__ ]::
   Report size statistics and import/export method information about
   named repositories, or with no argument the currently chosen repository.

`count` [>__outfile__ ]::
   Report a count of items in the selection set. Default set is everything
   in the currently-selected repo.

`sizes` [>__outfile__ ]::
   Print a report on data volume per branch; takes a selection set,
   defaulting to all events. The numbers tally the size of uncompressed
   blobs, commit and tag comments, and other metadata strings (a blob is
   counted each time a commit points at it). 
+
The numbers are not an exact measure of storage size: they are
intended mainly as a way to get information on how to efficiently
partition a repository that has become large enough to be
unwieldy.

[[examining-tree-states]]
=== Examining tree states

`manifest` [ _/regular expression/_ ] [ >__outfile__ ]::
   Takes an optional selection set argument defaulting to all commits, and
   an optional regular expression. For each commit in the selection set,
   print the mapping of all paths in that commit tree to the corresponding blob
   marks, mirroring what files would be created in a checkout of the commit. If a
   delimited regular expression is given, only print "_path_ `+->+` _mark_"
   lines for paths matching it. This command supports > redirection.

`checkout` _directory_::
   Takes a selection set which must resolve to a single commit, and
   a second argument. The second argument is interpreted as a directory
   name.  The state of the code tree at that commit is materialized beneath
   the directory.

`diff` [ >__outfile__ ]::
   Display the difference between commits. Takes a selection-set
   argument which must resolve to exactly two commits. Supports output
   redirection.

[[surgical]]
== Surgical Operations

These are the operations the rest of reposurgeon is designed
to support.

[[deletion]]
=== Commit deletion

`squash` [ _policy..._ ]::
   Combine or delete commits in a selection set of events. The
   default selection set for this command is empty. Has no effect on
   events other than commits unless the `--delete` policy is selected;
   see the '```delete```' command for discussion.
+
Normally, when a commit is squashed, its file operation list
(and any associated blob references) gets either prepended to the
beginning of the operation list of each of the commit's children or
appended to the operation list of each of the commit's parents. Then
children of a deleted commit get it removed from their parent set and
its parents added to their parent set.
+
The analogous operation is performed on commit comments, so no
comment text is ever outright discarded.  Exception: comments
consisting of "```++*** empty log message ***++```", as generated by
CVS, are ignored.
+
The default is to squash forward, modifying children; but see the
list of policy modifiers below for how to change this.
+
WARNING: It is easy to get the bounds of a `squash` command wrong, with
confusing and destructive results. Beware thinking you can squash on a
selection set to merge all commits except the last one into the last
one; what you will actually do is to merge all of them to the first
commit _after_ the selected set.
+
Normally, any tag pointing to a combined commit will also be
pushed forward.  But see the list of policy modifiers below for how to
change this.
+
Following all operation moves, every one of the altered file
operation lists is reduced to a shortest normalized form. The
normalized form detects various combinations of modification,
deletion, and renaming and simplifies the operation sequence as much
as it can without losing any information.
+
The following modifiers change these policies:
+
|===================================================================
| `--delete`      | Simply discards all file ops and tags associated with deleted commit(s).
| `--no-coalesce` | Do not normalize the modified commit operations.
| `--pushback`    | Append fileops to parents, rather than prepending to children.
| `--pushforward` | Prepend fileops to children. This is the default; it can be
specified in a lift script for explicitness about intentions.
| `--tagforward`  | Any tag on the deleted commit is pushed
forward to the first child rather than being deleted. This is the
default; it can be specified for explicitness.
| `--tagback`     | Any tag on the deleted commit is pushed
backward to the first parent rather than being deleted.
| `--quiet`       | Suppresses warning messages about deletion of commits with
non-delete fileops.
| `--complain`    | The opposite of `--quiet`. Can be specified for explicitness.
| `--empty-only`  | Complain if a squash operation modifies a nonempty comment.
| `--blobs`       | Allow deletion of selected blobs.
|===================================================================
+
Under any of these policies except `--delete`,
deleting a commit that has children does not back out the changes made
by that commit, as they will still be present in the blobs attached to
versions past the end of the deletion set.  All a delete does when the
commit has children is lose the metadata information about when and by
who those changes were actually made; after the delete any such
changes will be attributed to the first undeleted children of the
deleted commits.  It is expected that this command will be useful
mainly for removing commits mechanically generated by repository
converters such as `cvs2svn`.

`delete` [ _policy..._ ]::
   Delete a selection set of events. The default selection set for
   this command is empty. On a set of commits, this is equivalent to a
   `squash` with the `--delete` flag.  It unconditionally deletes tags,
   resets, and passthroughs; blobs can be removed only as a side effect
   of deleting every commit that points at them.

[[topology]]
=== Commit mutation

`merge`::
   Create a merge link. Takes a selection set argument, ignoring all but
   the lowest (source) and highest (target) members.  Creates a merge link
   from the highest member (child) to the lowest (parent).

`unmerge`::
   Linearize a commit. Takes a selection set argument, which must resolve
   to a single commit, and removes all its parents except for the first.
   It is equivalent to '__first_parent__, _commit_ reparent --rebase', where
   _commit_ is the same selection set as used with
   unmerge and __first_parent__ is a set resolving
   __commit__'s first parent (see the
   `reparent` command below).
   The main interest of the `unmerge` is that you don't
   have to find and specify the first parent yourself, saving time and avoiding
   errors when nearby surgery would make a manual first parent argument
   stale.

`reparent` [ _options_... ] [ _policy_ ]::
   Changes the parent list of a commit.  Takes a selection set,
   zero or more option arguments, and an optional policy argument.
+
Selection set: The selection set must resolve to one or more commits.  The
selected commit with the highest event number (not necessarily the
last one selected) is the commit to modify.  The remainder of the
selected commits, if any, become its parents: the selected commit
with the lowest event number (which is not necessarily the first one
selected) becomes the first parent, the selected commit with second
lowest event number becomes the second parent, and so on.  All
original parent links are removed.  Examples:
+
-----
# this makes 17 the parent of 33
17,33 reparent

# this also makes 17 the parent of 33
33,17 reparent

# this makes 33 a root (parentless) commit
33 reparent

# this makes 33 an octopus merge commit.  its first parent
# is commit 15, second parent is 17, and third parent is 22
22,33,15,17 reparent
-----
The option `--use-order` says to use the selection order to determine
which selected commit is the commit to modify and which are the
parents (and if there are multiple parents, their order).  The last
selected commit (not necessarily the one with the highest event
number) is the commit to modify, the first selected commit (not
necessarily the one with the lowest event number) becomes the first
parent, the second selected commit becomes the second parent, and so
on.  Examples:
+
-----
# this makes 33 the parent of 17
33,17 reparent --use-order

# this makes 17 an octopus merge commit.  its first parent
# is commit 22, second parent is 33, and third parent is 15
22,33,15,17 reparent --use-order
-----
+
Because ancestor commit events must appear before their
descendants, giving a commit with a low event number a parent with a
high event number triggers a re-sort of the events.  A re-sort assigns
different event numbers to some or all of the events.  Re-sorting only
works if the reparenting does not introduce any cycles.  To swap the
order of two commits that have an ancestorâ€“descendant relationship
without introducing a cycle during the process, you must reparent the
descendant commit first.
+
By default, the manifest of the reparented commit is computed before
modifying it; a `deleteall` and some fileops are
prepended so that the manifest stays unchanged even when the first
parent has been changed.  This behavior can be changed by specifying a
policy flag. `--rebase`. That inhibits the default behaviorâ€”no
`deleteall` is issued and the tree contents of all
descendants can be modified as a result.

`split` {`at`|`by`} _item_ ::
    The first argument is required to be a commit location; the second is
    a preposition which indicates which splitting method to use. If the
    preposition is '```at```', then the third argument must be an integer
    1-origin index of a file operation within the commit. If it is '```by```',
    then the third argument must be a pathname to be prefix-matched,
    pathname match is done first).
+
The commit is copied and inserted into a new position in the
event sequence, immediately following itself; the duplicate becomes
the child of the original, and replaces it as parent of the original's
children. Commit metadata is duplicated; the new commit then gets a
new mark. If the new commit has a legacy ID, the suffix '```.split```' is
appended to it.
+
Finally, some file operations â€” starting at the one matched or
indexed by the split argument â€” are moved forward from the original
commit into the new one.  Legal indices are 2-n, where n is the number
of file operations in the original commit.

`add` { `D` _path_ | `M` _perm_ _mark_ _path_ | `R` _source_ _target_ | `C` _source_ _target_}::
   To a selected commit, add a specified fileop.
+
For a *D* operation to be valid there must be an *M* operation for
the path in the commit's ancestry.  For an *M* operation to be valid,
the '`_perm_`' part must be a token ending with `755` or `644` and the '`_mark_`'
must refer to a blob that precedes the commit location.  For an *R* or *C*
operation to be valid, there must be an *M* operation for the source in
the commit's ancestry.

`remove` [ _index_ | _path_ | `deletes` ] [ `to` _commit_ ]::
   From a selected commit, remove a specified fileop.  The op must
   be one of (a) the keyword '```deletes```', (b) a file path, (c)
   a file path preceded by an op type set (some subset of the letters
   `DMRCN`), or (d) a 1-origin numeric index. The '```deletes```' keyword
   selects all *D* fileops in the commit; the others select one
   each.
+
If the '```to```' clause is present, the removed op is
appended to the commit specified by the following singleton selection
set. This option cannot be combined with '```deletes```'.
+
Note that this command does not attempt to scavenge blobs even
if the deleted fileop might be the only reference to them. This
behavior may change in a future release.

`tagify` [ `--canonicalize` ] [ `--tipdeletes` ] [ `--tagify-merges` ]::
   Search for empty commits and turn them into tags. Takes an optional
   selection set argument defaulting to all commits. For each commit in the
   selection set, turn it into a tag with the same message and author information
   if it has no fileops. By default merge commits are not considered, even if they
   have no fileops (thus no tree differences with their first parent). To change
   that, use the `--tagify-merges` option.
+
// Again, we can't use monospace here because the italics leak out (adoc 1.5.6)
The name of the generated tag will be '`emptycommit-_ident_`', where
_ident_ is generated from the legacy ID of the deleted commit, or from
its mark, or from its index in the repository, with a disambiguation
suffix if needed.
+
With the `--canonicalize` option, `tagify` tries harder to detect
trivial commits by first ensuring that all fileops of selected commits will
have an actual effect when processed by fast-import.
+
With the `--tipdeletes` option, `tagify` also considers branch tips
with only deleteall fileops to be candidates for tagification. The
corresponding tags get names of the form
// Two more cases where we can't use monospace.
'`tipdelete-_branchname_`' rather than the default
'`emptycommit-_ident_`'.
+
With the `--tagify-merges` option, `tagify` also tagifies merge
commits that have no fileops. When this is done the merge link is move to the
tagified commit's parent.

`reorder` [ `--quiet` ]::
   Re-order a contiguous range of commits.
+
Older revision control systems tracked change history on a per-file
basis, rather than as a series of atomic _changesets_,
which often made it difficult to determine the relationships between changes.
Some tools which convert a history from one revision control system to another
attempt to infer changesets by comparing file commit comment and time-stamp
against those of other nearby commits, but such inference is a heuristic and
can easily fail.  In the best case, when inference fails, a range of commits
in the resulting conversion which should have been coalesced into a single
changeset instead end up as a contiguous range of separate commits.  This
situation typically can be repaired easily enough with the
`coalesce` or `squash` commands.
+
However, in the worst case, numerous commits from several different
_topics_, each of which should have been one or more distinct
changesets, may end up interleaved in an apparently chaotic fashion.
To deal with such cases, the commits need to be re-ordered, so that
those pertaining to each particular topic are clumped together, and
then possibly squashed into one or more changesets pertaining to each
topic.  This command, `reorder`, can help with the first task; the
`squash` command with the second.
+
Selected commits are re-arranged in the order specified; for instance:
'```:7,:5,:9,:3 reorder```'.  The specified commit range must be
contiguous; each commit must be accounted for after re-ordering.  Thus, for
example, '```:5```' can not be omitted from '```:7,:5,:9,:3
reorder```'.  (To drop a commit, use the `delete` or
`squash` command.)
+
The selected commits must represent a linear history, however, the
lowest numbered commit being re-ordered may have multiple parents, and
the highest numbered may have multiple children.  Re-ordered commits
and their immediate descendants are inspected for rudimentary fileops
inconsistencies. Warns if re-ordering results in a commit trying to
delete, rename, or copy a file before it was ever created. Likewise,
warns if all of a commit's fileops become no-ops after
re-ordering. Other fileops inconsistencies may arise from re-ordering,
both within the range of affected commits and beyond; for instance,
moving a commit which renames a file ahead of a commit which
references the original name. Such anomalies can be discovered via
manual inspection and repaired with the `add` and `remove` (and
possibly `path`) commands. Warnings can be suppressed with `--quiet`.
+
In addition to adjusting their parent/child relationships, re-ordering
commits also re-orders the underlying events since ancestors must appear
before descendants, and blobs must appear before commits which reference them.
This means that events within the specified range will have different event
numbers after the operation.

[[branch-tag-reset]]
=== Branches, tag, and resets

`branch` _branchname_ { `rename` | `delete` } [ _arg_ ]::
   Rename or delete a branch (and any associated resets).  First argument
   must be an existing branch name; second argument must be one of the verbs
   '```rename```' or '```delete```'.
+
For a '```rename```', the third argument may be any token that is a
syntactically
valid branch name (but not the name of an existing branch).  If it does not
contain a '```/```' the prefix '```heads/```' is prepended.  If it does not
begin with '```refs/```', then '```refs/```' is prepended.
+
For a '```delete```', the name may optionally be a regular expression
wrapped in `//`;
if so, all objects of the specified type with names matching the regexp are
deleted.  This is useful for mass deletion of branches.  Such deletions can be
restricted by a selection set in the normal way.  No third argument is
required.

`tag` _tagname_ { `create` | `move` | `rename` | `delete` } [ _arg_ ]::
   Create, move, rename, or delete a tag.
+
Creation is a special case.  First argument is a name, which
must not be an existing tag. Takes a singleton event second argument
which must point to a commit.  A tag object pointing to the commit is
created and inserted just after the last tag in the repo (or just
after the last commit if there are no tags).  The tagger, committish,
and comment fields are copied from the commit's committer, mark, and
comment fields.
+
Otherwise, first argument must be an existing tag name; second
argument must be one of the verbs '```move```',
'```rename```', or '```delete```'.
+
For a '```move```', a third argument must be a singleton
selection set. For a "rename", the third argument may be
any token that is a syntactically valid tag name (but not the name of
an existing tag). For a "delete", no third argument is
required.
+
For a '```delete```', no third argument is required.  The name portion of a
delete may be a regexp wrapped in `//`; if so, all objects of the
specified type with names matching the regexp are deleted.  This is
useful for mass deletion of junk tags such as CVS branch-root tags.
+
The tagname may use C-style backslash escapes, such as `\s`.
+
The behavior of this command is complex because features which
present as tags may be any of three things: (1) True tag objects, (2)
lightweight tags, actually sequences of commits with a common
branchname beginning with '```refs/tags```' - in this case the
tag is considered to point to the last commit in the sequence, (3)
Reset objects.  These may occur in combination; in fact, stream
exporters from systems with annotation tags commonly express each of
these as a true tag object (1) pointing at the tip commit of a
sequence (2) in which the basename of the common branch field is
identical to the tag name.  An exporter that generates
lightweight-tagged commit sequences (2) may or may not generate resets
pointing at their tip commits.
+
This command tries to handle all combinations in a natural way by
doing up to three operations on any true tag, commit sequence, and
reset matching the source name. In a rename, all are renamed together.
In a delete, any matching tag or reset is deleted; then matching
branch fields are changed to match the branch of the unique descendant
of the tagged commit, if there is one.  When a tag is moved, no branch
fields are changed and a warning is issued.
+
Attempts to delete a lightweight tag may fail with the message
"`couldn't determine a unique successor`".  When this
happens, the tag is on a commit with multiple children that have
different branch labels. There is a hole in the specification
of git fast-import streams that leaves it uncertain how branch
labels can be safely reassigned in this case; rather than do
something risky, `reposurgeon` throws a recoverable
error.

`reset` _resetname_  { `create` | `move` | `rename` | `delete` } [ _arg_ ]::
   Create, move, rename, or delete a reset. Create is a special case; it
   requires a singleton selection which is the associated commit for the
   reset, takes as a first argument the name of the reset (which must not
   exist), and ends with the keyword create.
+
In the other modes, the first argument must match an
existing reset name; second argument must be one of the verbs
'```move```', '```rename```', or '```delete```'.
+
The reset name may use C-style backslash escapes, such as `\s`.
+
For a '```move```', a third argument must be a singleton
selection set. For a '```rename```', the third argument may be
any token that matches a syntactically valid reset name (but not
the name of an existing reset). For a '```delete```', no third
argument is required.
+
For either name, if it does not contain a '```/```' the
prefix '```heads/```' is prepended. If it does not begin with
'```refs/```', '```refs/```' is prepended.
+
An argument matches a reset's name if it is either the entire
reference (`refs/heads/FOO` or `refs/tags/FOO` for some
value of _FOO_) or the basename (e.g. `FOO`), or a suffix of the
form `heads/FOO` or `tags/FOO`.
An unqualified basename is assumed to refer to a head.
+
When a reset is renamed, commit branch fields matching the tag are
renamed with it to match.  When a reset is deleted, matching branch
fields are changed to match the branch of the unique descendant of the
tip commit of the associated branch, if there is one.  When a reset is
moved, no branch fields are changed.

[[splitmerge]]
=== Repository spiitting and merging

`divide`::
   Attempt to partition a repo by cutting the parent-child link
   between two specified commits (they must be adjacent). Does not take a
   general selection set.  It is only necessary to specify the
   parent commit, unless it has multiple children in which case the child
   commit must follow (separate it with a comma).
+
If the repo was named '`_foo_`', you will normally end up with two
repos named '`_foo_-early`' and '`_foo_-late`' (option and feature events at
the beginning of the early segment will be duplicated onto the
beginning of the late one.).  But if the commit graph would remain
connected through another path after the cut, the behavior changes.
In this case, if the parent and child were on the same branch '`_qux_`',
the branch segments are renamed '`_qux_-early`' and '`_qux_-late`' but
the repo is not divided.

`expunge` [ `--notagify` ] [ _path_ | /__regexp__/ ]...::
   Expunge files from the selected portion of the repo history; the
   default is the entire history.  The arguments to this command may be
   paths or regular expressions matching paths (regexps must
   be marked by being surrounded with `//`). String quotes and backslash
   escapes are interpreted when parsing the command line.
+
All filemodify (M) operations and delete (D) operations
involving a matched file in the selected set of events are
disconnected from the repo and put in a removal set.  Renames are
followed as the tool walks forward in the selection set; each triggers
a warning message. If a selected file is a copy +(C)+ target, the copy
will be deleted and a warning message issued. If a selected file is a
copy source, the copy target will be added to the list of paths to be
deleted and a warning issued.
+
After file expunges have been performed, any commits with no
remaining file operations will be removed, and any tags pointing to
them. By default each deleted commit is replaced with a tag of the form
// Making the tag name monospace causes the italics to leak in manpage output.
'`emptycommit-_ident_`' on the preceding commit unless
`--notagify` is specified as an argument. Commits with deleted
fileops pointing both in and outside the path set are not deleted, but are
cloned into the removal set.
+
The removal set is not discarded. It is assembled into a new
repository named after the old one with the suffix '```-expunges```' added.
Thus, this command can be used to carve a repository into sections by
file path matches.

`unite` [ `--prune` ] _reponame_...::
   Unite repositories. Name any number of loaded repositories; they will
   be united into one union repo and removed from the load list.  The
   union repo will be selected.
+
The root of each repo (other than the oldest repo) will be
grafted as a child to the last commit in the dump with a preceding
commit date.  This will produce a union repository with one branch for
each part.  Running last to first, duplicate tag and branch names will
be disambiguated using the source repository name (thus, recent
duplicates will get priority over older ones). After all grafts, marks
will be renumbered.
+
The name of the new repo will be the names of all parts concatenated,
separated by '```+```'. It will have no source directory or preferred system
type.
+
With the option `--prune`, at each join *D* operations for every
ancestral file existing will be prepended to the root commit, then it
will be canonicalized using the rules for squashing the effect will be
that only files with properly matching *M*, *R*, and *C* operations in the
root survive.

`graft` [ `--prune` ] _reponame_::
   For when unite doesn't give you enough control. This command may have
   either of two forms, selected by the size of the selection set.  The
   first argument is always required to be the name of a loaded repo.
+
If the selection set is of size 1, it must identify a single commit in
the currently chosen repo; in this case the named repo's root will
become a child of the specified commit. If the selection set is
empty, the named repo must contain one or more callouts matching a
commits in the currently chosen repo.
+
Labels and branches in the named repo are prefixed with its name; then
it is grafted to the selected one. Any other callouts in the named repo are also
resolved in the context of the currently chosen one. Finally, the
named repo is removed from the load list.
+
With the option `--prune`, prepend a deleteall operation into the root
of the grafted repository.

[[editing]]
=== Metadata editing

`msgout` [ >__outfile__ ] [ ``--filter=``/__regex__/ ] [ `--blobs` ]::
   Emit a file of messages in RFC2822 format representing
   the contents of repository metadata. Takes a selection set; members of
   the set other than commits, annotated tags, and passthroughs are
   ignored (that is, presently, blobs and resets), except that if the
   `--blobs` option is passed, blobs will also be included.
+
May have an option `--filter`, followed by `=` and a `/`-enclosed
regular expression.  If this is given, only headers with names
matching it are emitted.  In this context the name of the header
includes its trailing colon.

`msgin` [ `--create` ] [ `--empty-only` ] [ <__infile__ ] [ `--changed` >__outfile__ ]::
   Accept a file of messages in RFC2822 format representing the
   contents of the metadata in selected commits and annotated tags. Takes
   no selection set.  If there is an argument it will be taken as the
   name of a message file to read from; if no argument, or one of '```-```',
   reads from standard input.
+
Users should be aware that modifying an `Event-Number` or
`Event-Mark` field will change which event the update from that message
is applied to.  This is unlikely to have good results.
+
The header `CheckText`, if present, is examined to see if the comment text of
the associated event begins with it. If not, the item modification
is aborted. This helps ensure that you are landing updates ob the
events you intend.
+
If the `--create` modifier is present, new tags and
commits will be appended to the repository. In this case it is an error
for a tag name to match any existing tag name. Commit objects are created
with no fileops. If `Committer-Date` or `Tagger-Date` fields are not present
they are filled in with the time at which this command is executed. If
`Committer` or `Tagger` fields are not present, reposurgeon will attempt to
deduce the user's git-style identity and fill it in. If a singleton
commit set was specified for commit creations, the new commits are
made children of that commit.
+
Otherwise, if the `Event-Number` and `Event-Mark` fields are absent, the
`msgin` logic will attempt to match the commit or tag first by
Legacy-ID, then by a unique committer ID and timestamp pair.
+
If output is redirected and the modifier `--changed`
appears, a minimal set of modifications actually made is written to the
output file in a form that can be fed back in.
+
If the option `--empty-only` is given, this command will
throw a recoverable error if it tries to alter a message body that is neither
empty nor consists of the CVS empty-comment marker.

`setfield` _attribute_ _value_::
   In the selected objects (defaulting to none) set every instance
   of a named field to a string value.  The string may be quoted to
   include whitespace, and use C-style backslash escapes, such as `\n` and
   `\t`. 
+
Attempts to set nonexistent attributes are ignored. Valid values
for the attribute are internal field names; in particular, for 
commits, '```comment```' and '```branch```' are legal.
Consult the source code for other interesting values.
+
The special fieldnames '```author```', '```commitdate```' and '```authdate```'
apply only to commits in the range.  The latter two sets attribution
dates. The former sets the author's name and email address (assuming
the value can be parsed for both), copying the committer
timestamp. The author's timezone may be deduced from the email
address.

`edit` [ `--blobs` | `--not-last` ] ::
   Report the selection set of events to a tempfile as `msgout` does,
   call an editor on it, and update from the result as `msgin` does.
   If you do not specify an editor name as second argument, it will be
   taken from the `$EDITOR` variable in your environment.
   If `$EDITOR` is not set, `/usr/bin/editor` will be used as a fallback
   if it exists as a symlink to your default editor, as is the case on
   Debian, Ubuntu and their derivatives.
+
Normally this command ignores blobs because
`msgout` does.  However, if you specify a
selection set consisting of a single blob, your editor will be called
directly on the blob file; alternatively, as with `msgout`, the `--blobs`
option will include blobs in the file.
+
In the singleton blob case (without `--blobs`), will warn if the blob to
be edited appears in any commits whose descendants modify the same blob
(since changes will not propagate to the descendant versions).  This
warning may be suppressed (e.g. in scripts) with the `--not-last` option.
+
Supports < and > redirection.

`attribution` [ _selection_ ] { `show` | `set` | `delete` | `prepend` | `append` } [ _args_ ]::
   Inspect, modify, add, and remove commit and tag attributions.
+
Attributions upon which to operate are selected in much the same way as
events are selected, as described in <<selections>>.
_selection_ is an expression composed of
1-origin attribution-sequence numbers, '```$```' for last attribution,
'```..```' ranges, comma-separated items, '```(...)```' grouping,
set operations '```|```' union, '```&```' intersection, and '```~```' negation,
and function calls `@min()`, `@max()`, `@amp()`, `@pre()`, `@suc()`, `@srt()`.
Attributions can also be selected by visibility set '```=C```' for committers,
'```=A```' for authors, and '```=T```' for taggers.
Finally, '`/_regex_/`' will attempt to match the regular
expression _regex_ against an attribution name and email
address; '```/n```' limits the match to only the name, and '```/e```' to only
the email address.
+
With the exception of '```show```', all actions require an
explicit event selection upon which to operate. Available actions are:
+
[ _selection_ ] [ `show` ] [ >__file__ ]:::
   Inspect the selected attributions of the specified events (commits and
   tags).  The '```show```' keyword is optional.  If no attribution
   selection expression is given, defaults to all attributions. If no event
   selection is specified, defaults to all events.  Supports > redirection.

_selection_ `set` [ _name_ ] [ _email_ ] [ _date_ ]:::
   Assign _name_, _email_, _date_ to the selected attributions.  As a
   convenience, if only some fields need to be changed, the others can be
   omitted.  Arguments _name_, _email_, and _date_ can be given in any
   order.

[ _selection_ ] `delete` :::
   Delete the selected attributions.  As a convenience, deletes all authors
   if _selection_ is not given.  It is an error to delete the
   mandatory committer and tagger attributions of commit and tag events,
   respectively.

_selection_ `prepend` [ _name_ ] [ _email_ ] [ _date_ ]:::
   Insert a new attribution before the first attribution named by
   _selection_.  The new attribution has the same type (_committer_,
   _author_, or _tagger_) as the one before which it is being inserted.
   Arguments _name_, _email_, and _date_ can be given in any order.
+
If _name_ is omitted, an attempt is made to infer it
from _email_ by trying to match _email_
against an existing attribution of the event, with preference given to the
attribution before which the new attribution is being inserted.  Similarly,
_email_ is inferred from an existing matching
_name_.  Likewise, for _date_.
+
As a convenience, if _selection_ is empty or not
specified a new author is prepended to the author list.
+
It is presently an error to insert a new committer or tagger
attribution.  To change a committer or tagger, use '```set```'
instead.
+
_selection_ `append` [ _name_ ] [ _email_ ] [ _date_ ]:::
   Insert a new attribution after the last attribution named by
   _selection_.  The new attribution has the same type (_committer_,
   _author_, or _tagger_) as the one after which it is being inserted.
   Arguments _name_, _email_, and _date_ can be given in any order.
+
If _name_ is omitted, an attempt is made to infer it
from _email_ by trying to match _email_
against an existing attribution of the event, with preference given to the
attribution after which the new attribution is being inserted.  Similarly,
_email_ is inferred from an existing matching
_name_.  Likewise, for _date_.
+
As a convenience, if _selection_ is empty or not
specified a new author is appended to the author list.
+
It is presently an error to insert a new committer or tagger
attribution.  To change a committer or tagger, use '```set```'
instead.

`append` [ `--rstrip` ] [__text__]::
   Append text to the comments of commits and tags in the specified
   selection set. The text is the first token of the command and may
   be a quoted string. C-style escape sequences in the string are
   interpreted as one would expect.
+
If the option `--rstrip` is given, the comment is right-stripped before
the new text is appended. If the option `--legacy` is given, the string
'```%LEGACY%```' in the append payload is replaced with the commit's legacy-ID
before it is appended.

`gitify`::
   Attempt to massage comments into a git-friendly form with a blank
   separator line after a summary line.  This code assumes it can insert
   a blank line if the first line of the comment ends with '```.```', '```,```',
   '```:```', '```;```', '```?```', or '```!```'.  If the separator line is
   already present, the comment won't be touched.
+
Takes a selection set, defaulting to all commits and tags.

`filter` [ `--shell` | `--regex` | `--replace` | `--dedos` ]::
   Run blobs, commit comments, or tag comments in the selection set
   through the filter specified on the command line.
+
In any mode other than `--dedos`, attempting to specify a
selection set including both blobs and non-blobs (that is, commits or
tags) throws an error. Inline content in commits is filtered when the
selection set contains (only) blobs and the commit is within the range
bounded by the earliest and latest blob in the specification.
+
With `--shell`, the remainder of the line specifies a filter as a
shell command. Each blob or comment is presented to the filter on
standard input; the content is replaced with whatever the filter emits
to standard output.
+
When filtering blobs, if the command line contains the magic cookie
'%PATHS%' it is replaced with a space-separated list of all paths
that reference the blob.
+
With `--regex`, the remainder of the line is expected to be a
regular expression substitution written as `/from/to/` with `from` and
`to` being passed as arguments to the standard re.sub() function and
it applied to modify the content. Actually, any non-space character will
work as a delimiter in place of the `/`; this makes it easier to use
`/` in patterns. Ordinarily only the first such
substitution is performed; putting '```g```' after the slash replaces
globally, and a numeric literal gives the maximum number
of substitutions to perform. Other flags available restrict substitution
scope - '```c```' for comment text only, '```C```' for committer name only,
'```a```'
for author names only.  Note that parsing of a `--regex` argument will
be confused by any substring consisting of whitespace followed by `#`;
use '```\s```' rather than whitespace to avoid this.
+
With `--replace`, the behavior is like `--regex` but the expressions are
not interpreted as regular expressions. (This is slightly
faster).
+
With `--dedos`, DOS/Windows-style \r\n line terminators are
replaced with \n.

[[oaths]]
=== Path modifications

`path` _source_ `rename` [ `--force` ] _target_::
   Rename a path in every fileop of every selected commit.  The
   default selection set is all commits. The first argument is interpreted as a
   regular expression to match against paths; the second may contain
   back-reference syntax.
+
Ordinarily, if the target path already exists in the fileops, or
is visible in the ancestry of the commit, this command throws an
error.  With the `--force` option, these checks
are skipped.

`paths` [ `sub` | `sup` ] [ _dirname_ ] [ >__outfile__ ]::
   Takes a selection set. Without a modifier, list all paths
   touched by fileops in the selection set (which defaults to the entire
   repo). This reporting variant does >-redirection.
+
With the '```sub```' modifier, take a second argument that is a
directory name and prepend it to every path. With the '```sup```' modifier,
strip any directory argument from the start of the path if it appears there;
with no argument, strip the first directory component from every path.

`setperm` {``100644``|``100755``|``120000``} _path..._::
   For the selected objects (defaulting to none) take the first argument as an
   octal literal describing permissions.  All subsequent arguments are paths.
   For each *M* fileop in the selection set and exactly matching one of the
   paths, patch the permission field to the first argument value.

[[timequakes]]
=== Timequakes and time offsets

Modifying a repository so every commit in it has a unique
timestamp is often a useful thing to do, in order for every commit has
a unique action stamp that can be referred to in surgical
commands.

The '```lint```' command will tell you if you have timrestamp collisions.

`timequake`::
   Attempt to hack committer and author time stamps in the
   selection set (defaulting to all commits in the repository) to be
   unique.  Works by identifying collisions between parent and child,
   than incrementing child timestamps so they no longer coincide. Won't
   touch commits with multiple parents.
+
Because commits are checked in ascending order, this logic will
normally do the right thing on chains of three or more commits with
identical timestamps.
+ 
Any timestamp collisions left after this operation are probably
cross-branch and have to be individually dealt with using '```timebump```'
commands.

`timeoffset` [ _offset_ [ _timezone_ ] ]::
   Apply a time offset to all time/date stamps in the selected set.
   An offset argument is required; it may be in the form ++[+-]++_ss_,
   ++[+-]++_mm_:__ss__ or ++[+-]++_hh_:__mm__:__ss__. The leading
   sign is optional. With no argument, the default is 1 second.
+
Optionally you may also specify another argument in the form ++[+-]++_hhmm_, a
timezone literal to apply.  To apply a timezone without an offset, use
an offset literal of `0`, `+0` or `-0`.

Those of you twitchy about "rewriting history" should bear in
mind that the commit stamps in many older repositories were never very
reliable to begin with.
+
CVS in particular is notorious for shipping client-side
timestamps with timezone and DST issues (as opposed to UTC) that don't
necessary compare well with stamps from different clients of the same
CVS server. Thus, inducing a timequake in a CVS repo seldom produces
effects anywhere near as large than the measurement noise of the
repository's own timestamps.
+
Subversion was somewhat better about this, as commits were
stamped at the server, but older Subversion repositories often have
sections that predate the era of ubiquitous NTP time.

[[misc-surgical]]
=== Miscellanea

`blob`::
   Create a blob at mark :1 after renumbering other marks starting from
   :2.  Data is taken from stdin, which may be a here-doc.  This can be
   used with the add command to patch synthetic data into a repository.

`renumber`::
   Renumber the marks in a repository, from :1 up to :<n>
   where <n> is the count of the last mark. Just in case an importer
   ever cares about mark ordering or gaps in the sequence.
+
A side effect of this command is to clean up stray "done"
passthroughs that may have entered the repository via `graft`
operations.  After a renumber, the repository will have at most
one "done" and it will be at the end of the events.

`dedup`::
   Deduplicate blobs in the selection set.  If multiple blobs in the
   selection set have the same SHA1, throw away all but the first, and change
   fileops referencing them to instead reference the (kept) first blob.

`transcode` _codec_::
   Transcode blobs, commit comments and committer/author names, or tag
   comments and tag committer names in the selection set to UTF-8 from
   the character encoding specified on the command line.
+
Attempting to specify a selection set including both blobs and
non-blobs (that is, commits or tags) throws an error. Inline content
in commits is filtered when the selection set contains (only) blobs
and the commit is within the range bounded by the earliest and latest
blob in the specification.
+
The encoding argument must name one of the codecs known to the Golang
standard codecs library. In particular, '```latin1```' is a valid codec name.
+
Errors in this command are fatal, because an error may leave
repository objects in a damaged state.
+
The theory behind the design of this command is that the
repository might contain a mixture of encodings used to enter commit
metadata by different people at different times. After using `=I` to
identify metadata containing non-Unicode high bytes in text, a human
must use context to identify which particular encodings were used in
particular event spans and compose appropriate transcode commands
to fix them up.

`debranch` _source-branch_ [ _target-branch_ ]::
   Takes one or two arguments which must be the names of source and
   target branches; if the second (target) argument is omitted it
   defaults to `refs/heads/master`.  Any trailing segment of a branch
   name is accepted as a synonym for it; thus `master` is the same as
   `refs/heads/master`. Does not take a selection set.
+
The history of the source branch is merged into the history of
the target branch, becoming the history of a subdirectory with the
name of the source branch.  Any resets of the source branch are
removed.

`strip` [ `blobs` | `reduce` ]::
   Reduce the selected repository to make it a more tractable test
   case. Use this when reporting bugs.
+
With the modifier '```blobs```', replace each blob in the repository
with a small, self-identifying stub, leaving all metadata and DAG
topology intact. This is useful when you are reporting a bug, for
reducing large repositories to test cases of manageable size.
+
A selection set is effective only with the '```blobs```' option,
defaulting to all blobs. The '```reduce```' mode always acts on the entire
repository.
+
With the modifier '```reduce```', perform a topological reduction that
throws out uninteresting commits.  If a commit has all file
modifications (no deletions or copies or renames) and has exactly one
ancestor and one descendant, then it may be boring.  To be fully
boring, it must also not be referred to by any tag or reset.
Interesting commits are not boring, or have a non-boring parent or
non-boring child.
+
With no modifiers, this command strips blobs.

[[artifact-removal]]
== Artifact handling

Some commands automate fixing various kinds of artifacts
associated with repository conversions from older systems.

[[attributions]]
=== Attributions

`authors` [ `read` | `write` ] [ <__filename__ ] [ >__filename__ ]::
   Apply or dump author-map information for the specified selection
   set, defaulting to all events.
+
Lifts from CVS and Subversion may have only usernames local to
the repository host in committer and author IDs. DVCSes want email
addresses (net-wide identifiers) and complete names. To supply the map
from one to the other, an authors file is expected to consist of
lines each beginning with a local user ID, followed by a '```=```' (possibly
surrounded by whitespace) followed by a full name and email address,
optionally followed by a timezone offset field.  Thus:
+
--------
fred = Fred J. Foonly <foonly@foo.com> America/New_York
--------
+
An authors file may also contain lines of this form
+
--------
+ Fred J. Foonly <foonly@foobar.com> America/Los_Angeles
--------
+
These are interpreted as aliases for the last preceding '```=```'
entry that may appear in ChangeLog files. When such an alias is
matched on a ChangeLog attribution line, the author attribution
for the commit is mapped to the basename, but the timezone is used
as is.  This accommodates people with past addresses (possibly at)
different locations) unifying such aliases in metadata so searches
and statistical aggregation will work better.
+
An authors file may have comment lines beginning with '```#```'; these
are ignored.
+
When an authors file is applied, email addresses in committer and author
metadata for which the local ID matches between `<` and `@` are replaced
according to the mapping (this handles git-svn lifts). Alternatively,
if the local ID is the entire address, this is also considered a match
(this handles what git-cvsimport and cvs2git do). If a timezone was
specified in the map entry, that person's author and committer dates
are mapped to it.
+
With the '```read```' modifier, or no modifier, apply author mapping
data (from standard input or a `<`-redirected file).  May be useful
if you are editing a repo or dump created by
`cvs2git` or by `git-svn` invoked without `-A`.
+
With the '```write```' modifier, write a mapping file that could be
interpreted by '```authors read```', with entries for each
unique committer, author, and tagger (to standard output or a
`>`-redirected mapping file). This may be helpful as a start on
building an authors file, though each part to the right of an equals
sign will need editing.

[[ignore]]
=== Ignore patterns

reposurgeon recognizes how supported VCSes represent file ignores (CVS
_.cvsignore_ files lurking untranslated in older Subversion
repositories, Subversion ignore properties,
_.gitignore_/_.hgignore_/_.bzrignore_ file in other systems) and moves
ignore declarations among these containers on repo input and
output. This will be sufficient if the ignore patterns are exact
filenames.

Translation may not, however, be perfect when the ignore patterns are
Unix glob patterns or regular expressions.  This compatibility table
describes which patterns will translate; "plain" indicates a plain
filename with no glob or regexp syntax or negation, "no !" means no
negated regexps, and "no RE:" means the RE prefix for a regular
expression does not work.

RCS has no ignore files or patterns and is therefore not
included in the table.

|==============================================================================================================

The hg rows and columns of the table describes compatibility to
hg's glob syntax rather than its default regular-expression syntax.
When writing to an hg repository from any other kind,
reposurgeon prepends to the output .hgignore a
'```syntax: glob```' line.

For dealing with unusual cases, there's this:

`ignores` [ `rename` ] [ `translate` ] [ `defaults` ]::
   Intelligent handling of ignore-pattern files.
   This command fails if no repository has been selected or no preferred write
   type has been set for the repository.  It does not take a selection set.
+
If the rename modifier is present, this command attempts to rename all
ignore-pattern files to whatever is appropriate for the preferred type -
e.g. _.gitignore_ for git, _.hgignore_ for hg, etc.  This option does not
cause any translation of the ignore files it renames.
+
If the translate modifier is present, syntax translation of each ignore
file is attempted. At present, the only transformation the code knows
is to prepend a '```syntax: glob```' header if the preferred type is hg.
+
If the defaults modifier is present, the command attempts to prepend
these default patterns to all ignore files. If no ignore file is
created by the first commit, it will be modified to create one
containing the defaults.  This command will error out on prefer types
that have no default ignore patterns (git and hg, in particular).  It
will also error out when it knows the import tool has already set
default patterns.

[[reference-lifting]]
=== Reference lifting

This group of commands is meant for fixing up references in commits
that are in the format of older version control systems.  The general
workflow is this: first, go over the comment history and change all
old-fashioned commit references into machine-parseable cookies.  Then,
automatically turn the machine-parseable cookie into action stamps.
The point of dividing the process this way is that the first part is
hard for a machine to get right, while the second part is prone to errors
when a human does it.

A Subversion cookie is a comment substring of the form
'```++[[SVN:ddddd]]++```' (example: '```++[[SVN:2355]]++```')
with the revision read directly
via the Subversion exporter, deduced from git-svn metadata, or
matching a `$Revision$` header embedded in blob data for the
filename.

A CVS cookie is a comment substring of the form
'```++[[CVS:filename:revision]]++```'
(example: '```++[[CVS:src/README:1.23]]++```') with the
revision matching a CVS `$Id$` or `$Revision$` header embedded in blob
data for the filename.

A mark cookie is of the form '```++[[:dddd]]++```' and is simply a reference
to the specified mark. You may want to hand-patch this in when one of
previous forms is inconvenient.

An action stamp is an RFC3339 timestamp, followed by a '```!```',
followed by an author email address (author is preferred rather than
committer because that timestamp is not changed when a patch is
replayed on to a branch, but the code to make a stamp for a commit
will fall back to the committer if no author field is present).  It
attempts to refer to a commit without being VCS-specific.
Thus, instead of "```commit 304a53c2```" or "```r2355```",
"```++2011-10-25T15:11:09Z!fred@foonly.com++```".

The following git aliases allow git to work directly with action
stamps.  Append it to your _~/.gitconfig_; if you
already have an `[alias]` section, leave off the first line.

// Keep this updated from reposurgeon-git-aliases
--------
[alias]
	# git stamp <commit-ish> - print a reposurgeon-style action stamp
	stamp = show -s --format='%cI!%ce'

	# git scommit <stamp> <rev-list-args> - list most recent commit that matches <stamp>.
	# Must also specify a branch to search or --all, after these arguments.
	scommit = "!f(){ d=${1%%!*}; a=${1##*!}; arg=\"--until=$d -1\"; if [ $a != $1 ]; then arg=\"$arg --committer=$a\"; fi; shift; git rev-list $arg ${1:+\"$@\"}; }; f"

	# git scommits <stamp> <rev-list-args> - as above, but list all matching commits.
	scommits = "!f(){ d=${1%%!*}; a=${1##*!}; arg=\"--until=$d --after $d\"; if [ $a != $1 ]; then arg=\"$arg --committer=$a\"; fi; shift; git rev-list $arg ${1:+\"$@\"}; }; f"

	# git smaster <stamp> - list most recent commit on master that matches <stamp>.
	smaster = "!f(){ git scommit \"$1\" master --first-parent; }; f"
	smasters = "!f(){ git scommits \"$1\" master --first-parent; }; f"

	# git shs <stamp> - show the commits on master that match <stamp>.
	shs = "!f(){ stamp=$(git smasters $1); shift; git show ${stamp:?not found} $*; }; f"

	# git slog <stamp> <log-args> - start git log at <stamp> on master
	slog = "!f(){ stamp=$(git smaster $1); shift; git log ${stamp:?not found} $*; }; f"

	# git sco <stamp> - check out most recent commit on master that matches <stamp>.
	sco = "!f(){ stamp=$(git smaster $1); shift; git checkout ${stamp:?not found} $*; }; f"
--------

There is a rare case in which an action stamp will not refer uniquely
to one commit. It is theoretically possible that the same author might
check in revisions on different branches within the one-second
resolution of the timestamps in a fast-import stream.  There is
nothing to be done about this; tools using action stamps need to be
aware of the possibility and throw a warning when it occurs.

In order to support reference lifting, reposurgeon internally builds a
legacy-reference map that associates revision identifiers in older
version-control systems with commits.  The contents of this map comes
from three places: (1) `cvs2svn:rev` properties if the repository was
read from a Subversion dump stream, (2) `$Id$` and `$Revision$` headers in
repository files, and (3) the _.git/cvs-revisions_
created by '```git cvsimport```'.

The detailed sequence for lifting possible references is this: first,
find possible CVS and Subversion references with the `references` or
`=N` visibility set; then replace them with equivalent cookies; then run
`references lift` to turn the cookies into action stamps (using the
information in the legacy-reference map) without having to do the
lookup by hand.

`references` [ `list` | `edit` | `lift` ] [ >__outfile__ ]::
   With the modifier '```list```', list commit and tag comments for strings
   that might be CVS- or Subversion-style revision identifiers. This will
   be useful when you want to replace them with equivalent cookies that
   can automatically be translated into VCS-independent action
   stamps. This reporting command supports >-redirection.
   It is equivalent to '```=N list```'.
+
With the modifier '```edit```', edit the set where revision IDs are
found.  This version of the command supports < and > redirection.
This is equivalent to '```=N edit```'.
+
With the modifier '```lift```', attempt to resolve Subversion and CVS
cookies in comments into action stamps using the legacy map. An action
stamp is a timestamp/email/sequence-number combination uniquely
identifying the commit associated with that blob, as described in
<<style>>.
+
It is not guaranteed that every such reference will be resolved,
or even that any at all will be. Normally all references in history
from a Subversion repository will resolve, but CVS references are less
likely to be resolvable.

`legacy` [ `read` | `write` ] [ <__filename__ ] [ >__filename__ ]::
   Apply or list legacy-reference information. Does not take a
   selection set. The '```read```' variant reads from standard input or a
   `<`-redirected filename; the '```write```' variant writes to standard
   output or a `>`-redirected filename.  If neither is specified, defaults
   to '```read```'.
+
A legacy-reference file maps reference cookies to (committer,
commit-date, sequence-number) pairs; these in turn (should) uniquely
identify a commit.  The format is two whitespace-separated fields:
the cookie followed by an action stamp identifying the commit.
+
It should not normally be necessary to use this command.  The
legacy map is automatically preserved through repository reads and
rebuilds, being stored in the file _legacy-map_ under
the repository subdirectory.

[[changelogs]]
=== Changelogs

CVS, Subversion and Mercurial do not have separated notions of committer
and author for changesets; when lifted to a VCS that does, like git,
their one author field is used for both.

However, if the project used the FSF ChangeLog convention,
many changesets will include a ChangeLog modification listing an
author for the commit. In the common case that the changeset was
derived from a patch and committed by a project maintainer,
but the ChangeLog entry names the actual author, this information
can be recovered.

Use the '```changelogs```' command.  This takes no arguments, but may
take a selection set; the default is all commits. It mines the
selected ChangeLog files for authorship data. 

An optional following argument is a delimited regular expression to
match the basename of files that should be treated as changelogs. The
default expression is '```/^ChangeLog$/```'.

It assumes such files are in the format used by FSF projects: entry header
lines begin with YYYY-MM-DD and are followed by a fullname/address.
When a ChangeLog file modification is found in a clique, the entry
header at or before the section changed since its last revision is
parsed and the address is inserted as the commit author.

If the entry header contains an email address but no name, a name
will be filled in if possible by looking for the address in author
map entries.

In accordance with FSF policy for ChangeLogs, any date in an
attribution header is discarded and the committer date is used.
However, if the name is an author-map alias with an associated timezone,
that zone is used.

The Co-Author convention described in the Linux kernel's
https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/CommitMessageConventions[co-author message conventions]
is observed: If an attribution header is followed
by a whitespace-led line containing only a valid email address. that
name becomes the payload of a "Co-Author" header that is appended
to the change comment for the containing commit.

The command reports statistics on how many commits were altered.

[[coalescence]]
=== Clique coalescence

When lifting a history from a version-control system that lacls
changesets, it is useful to have a way to recognize cliwues of
per-file changes that oughtvto be grouped into changesets.

You won't need this for CVS because cvs-fast-export does
clique coalesxence itself.

`coalesce` [ `--debug` | `--changelog` ] [ _timefuzz_ ]::
   Scan the selection set for runs of commits with identical
   comments close to each other in time (this is a common form of scar
   tissues in repository up-conversions from older file-oriented
   version-control systems).  Merge these cliques by deleting all but the
   last commit, in order; fileops from the deleted commits are pushed
   forward to that last one
+
The optional second argument, if present, is a maximum time
separation in seconds; the default is 90 seconds.
+
The default selection set for this command is `=C`, all
commits. Occasionally you may want to restrict it, for example to
avoid coalescing unrelated cliques of "```++*** empty log message ***++```"
commits from CVS lifts.
+
With the `--debug` option, show messages about mismatches.
+
With the `--changelog` option, any commit with a comment
containing the string '```empty log message```' (such as is generated by
CVS) and containing exactly one file operation modifying a path ending
in _ChangeLog_ is treated specially.  Such
ChangeLog commits are considered to match any commit before them by
content, and will coalesce with it if the committer matches and the
commit separation is small enough.  This option handles a convention
used by Free Software Foundation projects.

[[scirpting-debugging]]
== Scripting and debugging support

[[macros]]
=== Variables, macros, and scripts

Occasionally you will need to issue a large number of complex surgical
commands of very similar form, and it's convenient to be able to
package that form so you don't need to do a lot of error-prone typing.
For those occasions, reposurgeon supports simple
forms of named variables and macro expansion.

`assign` [ _name_ ]::
   Compute a leading selection set and assign it to a symbolic name.
   It is an error to assign to a name that is already assigned, or to
   any existing branch name.  Assignments may be cleared by sequence
   mutations (though not ordinary deletions); you will see a warning
   when this occurs.
+
With no selection set and no name, list all assignments.
+
If the option `--singleton` is given, the assignment will throw an error
if the selection set is not a singleton.
+
Use this to optimize out location and selection computations
that would otherwise be performed repeatedly, e.g. in macro calls.

`unassign` _name_::
   Unassign a symbolic name.  Throws an error if the name is not
   assigned.

`names` [ >__outfile__ ]::
   List the names of all known branches and tags.  Tells
   you what things are legal within angle brackets and
   parentheses.
   
`define` _name_ _body_::
   Define a macro.  The first whitespace-separated token is the
   name; the remainder of the line is the body, unless it is
   "```{```", which begins a multi-line macro terminated by
   a line beginning with "```}```".
+
A later '```do```' call can invoke this macro.
+
The command '```define```' by itself without a name or
body produces a macro list.

`do` _name_ _arguments_...::
   Expand and perform a macro.  The first whitespace-separated
   token is the name of the macro to be called; remaining tokens replace
   `+{0}+`, `+{1}+`... in the macro definition. Tokens may contain whitespace if
   they are string-quoted; string quotes are stripped. Macros can call
   macros.
+
If the macro expansion does not itself begin with a selection set,
whatever set was specified before the '```do```' keyword is available to
the command generated by the expansion.

`undefine` _name_::
   Undefine the named macro.

Here's an example to illustrate how you might use this.  In CVS
repositories of projects that use the GNU ChangeLog convention, a very
common pre-conversion artifact is a commit with the comment "```++*** empty
log message ***++```" that modifies only a ChangeLog entry explaining the
commit immediately previous to it. The following

--------
define changelog <{0}> & /empty log message/ squash --pushback
do changelog 2012-08-14T21:51:35Z
do changelog 2012-08-08T22:52:14Z
do changelog 2012-08-07T04:48:26Z
do changelog 2012-08-08T07:19:09Z
do changelog 2012-07-28T18:40:10Z
--------

is equivalent to the more verbose

--------
<2012-08-14T21:51:35Z> & /empty log message/ squash --pushback
<2012-08-08T22:52:14Z> & /empty log message/ squash --pushback
<2012-08-07T04:48:26Z> & /empty log message/ squash --pushback
<2012-08-08T07:19:09Z> & /empty log message/ squash --pushback
<2012-07-28T18:40:10Z> & /empty log message/ squash --pushback
--------

but you are less likely to make difficult-to-notice errors typing the
first version.

(Also note how the text regexp acts as a failsafe against the
possibility of typing a wrong date that doesn't refer to a commit with
an empty comment. This was a real-world example from the CVS-to-git
conversion of groff.)

`script` _filename_ [ _arg_... ]::
   Takes a filename and optional following arguments.
   Reads each line from the file and executes it as a command.
+
During execution of the script, the script name replaces the
string `$0` and the optional following arguments (if any) replace the
strings `$1`, `$2` ... `$n` in the script text. This is done before
tokenization, so the `$1` in a string like '```foo$1bar```' will
be expanded.  Additionally, `$$` is expanded to the current process ID
(which may be useful for scripts that use tempfiles).
+
Within scripts (and only within scripts) reposurgeon accepts a
slightly extended syntax: First, a backslash ending a line signals
that the command continues on the next line. Any number of consecutive
lines thus escaped are concatenated, without the ending backslashes,
prior to evaluation. Second, a command that takes an input filename
argument can instead take literal following data in the syntax of a
shell here-document. That is: if the '```<filename```' is replaced by
'```<<EOF```', all following lines in the script up to a terminating
line consisting only of '```EOF```' will be read, placed in a
temporary file, and that file fed to the command and afterwards
deleted.  `EOF` may be replaced by any string. Backslashes have no
special meaning while reading a here-document.
+
Scripts may have comments.  Any line beginning with a '```++#++```' is
ignored. If a line has a trailing position that begins with one or more
whitespace characters followed by '```++#++```', that trailing portion is
ignored.
+
Scripts may call other scripts to arbitrary depth.

`print` _output-text..._::
   Does nothing but ship its argument line to standard
   output. Useful in scripts for regression tests.

Here are some more advanced examples of scrpting:

--------
define lastchange {
@max(=B & [/ChangeLog/] & /{0}/B)? list
}
--------

List the last commit that refers to a ChangeLog file containing
a specified string. (The trick here is that ? extends the singleton
set consisting of the last eligible ChangeLog blob to its set of
referring commits, and `list` only notices the
commits.)

--------
index >index.txt
shell <index.txt awk '/refs\/tags/ {print $4}' | sort | uniq | while read t; do echo "tag $(basename "$t") rename $(basename "$t" | sed -e 's/sample/example/')"; done >renames.script
script renames.script
--------

Mass-rename tags, replacing "sample" on the basename with
"example". Illustrates a general technique of generating reposurgeon commands via
shell that you then execute with the '```script```' command. Enabling this
technique is the reason as many commands as possible support redirects.

[[housekeeping]]
=== Help and housekeeping

None of these take a selection set:

`set` [ _option_ ]::
   Turn on an option flag.  With no arguments, list all options.
+
Most options are described in conjunction with the specific
operations that they modify. One of general interest is
'```compressblobs```'; this enables compression on the blob
files in the internal representation reposurgeon uses for editing
repositories. With this option, reading and writing of repositories is
slower, but editing a repository requires less (sometimes much less)
disk space.

`clear` [ _option_ ]::
   Turn off an option flag.  With no arguments, list all options.

`gc` [ _percent_ ]::
   Trigger a garbage collection. Scavenges and removes all blob objects
   that no longer have references, e.g. as a result of delete operations
   on repositories. This is followed by a Go-runtime garbage collection.
+
The optional argument, if present, is passed as a
https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/debug/#SetGCPercent[SetGCPercent]
call to the Go runtime. The initial value is 100; setting it lower
causes more frequent garbage collection and may reduce maximum
working set, while setting it higher causes less frequent garbage
collection and will raise maximum working set.

`when` _timespec_::
   Interconvert between git timestamps (integer Unix time plus TZ) and
   RFC3339 format.  Takes one argument, autodetects the format.  Useful
   when eyeballing export streams.  Also accepts any other supported
   date format and converts to RFC3339.

[[instrumentation]]
=== Debugging and diagnostics

A few commands have been implemented primarily for debugging and
regression-testing purposes, but may be useful in unusual
circumstances.

The output of most of these commands can individually be redirected to
a named output file. Where indicated in the syntax, you can prefix the
output filename with '```>```' and give it as a following argument.

`resolve` [ _label-text..._ ]::
   Does nothing but resolve a selection-set expression
   and echo the resulting event-number set to standard
   output. The remainder of the line after the command is used
   as a label for the output.
+
Implemented mainly for regression testing, but may be useful
for exploring the selection-set language.

`log` [ _logclasses..._ ]::
    Without an argument, list all log message classes, prepending a `+`
    if that class is enabled and a `-` if not.
+
Otherwise, it expects a space-separated list of '```++<+ or -><log
message class>++```' entries, and enables (with `+`) or disables (with `-`) the
corresponding log message class. The special keyword '```all```' can be used
to affect all the classes at the same time.
+ 
For instance, '```++log -all +shout +warn++```' will disable all classes except
"shout" and "warn", which is the default setting. '```log +all -svnparse```'
would enable logging everything but messages from the svn parser.
+
You can get a list of other log message classes from '```help log```'.

`logfile` [ _path_ ]::
   Error, warning, and diagnostic messages are normally emitted to standard
   error.  This command, with a nonempty _path_ argument, directs them to 
   the specified file instead.  Without an argument, reports what logfile is
   set.

`version` [ _version_... ]::
   With no argument, display the program version and the list of
   VCSes directly supported.  With argument, declare the major version
   (single digit) or full version (_major_._minor_) under which the enclosing
   script was developed.  The program will error out if the major version
   has changed (which means the surgical language is not backwards
   compatible).
+
It is good practice to start your lift script with a version
requirement, especially if you are going to archive it for later
reference.

`prompt` [ _format..._ ]::
   Set the command prompt format to the value of the command line; with
   an empty command line, display it. The prompt format is evaluated in
   after each command with the following dictionary substitutions:
+
--
[horizontal]
chosen::: The name of the selected repository, or None if none is currently
selected.
--
+
Thus, one useful format might be '```rs[%(chosen)s]%% ```'.
+
More format items may be added in the future.  The default
prompt corresponds to the format '```reposurgeon%% ```'. The format line is
evaluated with shell quoting of tokens, so that spaces can be
included.

[[profiling]]
=== Profiling

`elapsed`::
  Display elapsed time since start.

`timing` [ >__outfile__ ]::
   Display statistics on phase timing in repository analysis.
   Mainly of interest to developers trying to speed up the program.
+
If the command has following text, this creates a new, named time mark
that will be visible in a later report; this may be useful during 
long-running conversion recipes.

`readlimit` [number]::
   Set a maximum number of commits to read from a stream.  If the limit
   is reached before EOF it will be logged. Mainly useful for
   benchmarking. Without arguments, report the read limit; 0 means
   there is none.

`memory`::
   Report memory usage.  Runs a garbage-collect before reporting so the
   figure will better reflect storage currently held in loaded repositories;
   this will not affect the reported high-water mark.

`profile` [ `live` | `start` | `save` ] [ _args..._ ]::
    Profiling is enabled by default, but viewing the profile data
    requires either starting the http server with '```profile live```', or
    saving it to a file with '```profile save```'. When no arguments are
    given it prints out the available types of profiles.

`exit`::
   Exit, reporting the time. Included here because, while EOT will
   also cleanly exit the interpreter, this command reports elapsed time
   since start.

[[mercurial]]
== Working with Mercurial
There is a built-in extractor class to perform extractions from
Mercurial repositories.

Mercurial branches are exported as branches in the exported
repository and tags are exported as tags. By default, bookmarks are
ignored. You can specify explicit handling for bookmarks by setting
'```reposurgeon.bookmarks```' in your _.hg/hgrc_. Set the value to the
prefix that reposurgeon should use for bookmarks.

For example, if your bookmarks represent branches, put this at
the bottom of your _.hg/hgrc_:

--------
[reposurgeon]
bookmarks=heads/
--------

If you do that, it's your responsibility to ensure that branch names
do not conflict with bookmark names. You can add a prefix like
'```bookmarks=heads/feature-```' to disambiguate as necessary.

Alternatively, you can import directly using
https://github.com/kilork/hg-git-fast-import[hg-git-fast-import].
This importer is not yet well tested, but may be substantially
faster than using the extractor harness. You may wish to run
test conversions using both methods and compare them.

[[hg-subrepo]]
=== Mercurial subrepositories
The hg extractor does not attempt to recursively handle subrepos.  Rather,
it will extract the history of the top-level repo, in which _.hgsub_ and
_.hgsubstate_ will be treated as regular files.  If you wish to translate
these into the semantics of your target VCS, you will need to do so with
surgical primitives after reading the history into reposurgeon.

[[subversion]]
== Working with Subversion

reposurgeon can read Subversion dumpfiles. You must point it at a
repository, not a checkout directory.

The transaction model of Subversion is nothing like that of the 
DVCSes (distributed version control systems) that followed it. Two of the more
obvious differences are around tags and branches.

A Subversion tag isn't an annotation attached to a commit. The
Subversion data model is that a history is a sequence of surgical
operations on a tree; there are no annotation tags as such, a tag is
just another branch of the tree.  Accordingly a Subversion tag is a copy
of the state of an entire branch at a particular revision. This can be
losslessly translated to an annotation only if no additional commits
are added to the tag branch after the copy. But nothing prevents this!
reposurgeon tries to do the right thing,
creating a DVCS-style annotated tag when it can and otherwise preserving the
changes as commits, using a lightweight tag to point at the tip.

There is a subtler problem around branches themselves. In a
DVCS, deleting a branch removes it from the repository history
entirely, a fact of some significance since repositories are copied
around often enough that keeping every discarded experiment forever
would eventually drown the live content in superannuated cruft.
Subversion repositories, on the other hand, are designed on the
assumption that they sit on one server and never move.  A Subversion
branch is just a directory in the branch namespace; if you delete it,
you won't see it in following revisions but if you update to an older
one that content will still be there. By default, reposurgeon will delete
the corresponding branches as if the deletion was done in a DVCS, keeping
only the commits that are also part of other branches' histories, but
you can tell it to preserve the branches instead and give them unambiguous
names in the `refs/deleted` namespace.

Bad things can happen when a tag directory is created, copied
from, deleted, then recreated from a different source directory. This
is a place where the Subversion model of tags clashes badly with the
changeset-DAG model used by git and other DVCSes. Especially if the
same tag is recreated later!  The obvious thing to do when converting
this sequence would be to just nuke the tag history from the
deletion back to its branch point, but that will cause problems if a
copy operation was ever sourced in the deleted branch (and this does
happen!).

What reposurgeon does instead is preserve the most recent
branch with any given name, so the view back from the repository
had and branch tips has correct content. This does however mean that
the content of any branch with the same previous to the visible
*most recent) one is discarded.  However, see the --preserve option
of the read command.

=== Reading Subversion repositories

Certain optional modifiers on the read command change
its behavior when reading Subversion repositories:

`--nobranch`::
Suppress branch analysis. The generated git repository will mirror the
whole subversion tree, with trunk and branches as subdirectories.
No directory deletions are translated to branch deletions, since no
directories are seen as branches in the first place.

`--ignore-properties`::
Suppress read-time warnings about discarded property
settings. 

`--user-ignores`::
By default reposurgeon filters in-tree _.gitignore_ files found in the history
because they would clash with those generated from `svn:ignore` properties.
Using this option makes _.gitignore_ files be passed through. They will still
be overridden by generated _.gitignore_ files so this option is often used
along with `--no-automatic-ignores`.

`--use-uuid`::
If the `--use-uuid` read option is set, the repository's
UUID will be used as the hostname when faking up email addresses, a la
`git-svn`.  Otherwise, addresses will be generated the way `git cvs-import` does
it, simply copying the username into the address field.

`--no-automatic-ignores`::
Do not generate _.gitignore_ files from `svn:ignore` properties.

`--preserve`::
When a branch or tag was deleted in SVN, preserve the history up to
deletion in a git ref under `refs/deleted/`, instead of deleting the branch
and only keeping the commits that are also part of the history of other
branches.

`--cvsignores`::
Suppress the normal deletion of _.cvsignore_ files.

These modifiers can go anywhere in any order on the read command
line after the read verb. They must be whitespace-separated.

It is also possible to embed a magic comment in a Subversion
stream file to set these options. Prefix a space-separated list of
them with the magic comment '``` # reposurgeon-read-options:```'; the
leading space is required. This may be useful when synthesizing test
loads; in particular, a stream file that does not set up a standard
`trunk/branches/tags` directory layout can use this to perform a
mapping of all commits onto the master branch that the git importer
will accept.

Here are the rules used for mapping subdirectories in a
Subversion repository to branches:

* At any given time there is a set of eligible
paths and path wildcards which declare potential branches.
See the documentation of the `branchify` command
for how to alter this set, which initially consists of
{`trunk`, `tags/*`, `branches/*`, and `*`}.

* A repository is considered "`__flat__`" if it has no
directory that matches a path or path wildcard in the branchify set.
All commits in a flat repository are assigned to branch `master`, and
what would have been branch structure becomes directory structure.  In
this case, we're done; all the other rules apply to non-flat
repos.

* If you give the option `--nobranch` when reading a Subversion
repository, branch analysis is skipped and the repository is treated
as though flat (left as a linear sequence of commits on
`refs/heads/master`).  This may be useful if your repository
configuration is highly unusual and you need to do your own branch
surgery. Note that this option will disable partitioning of mixed
commits.

* If '```trunk```' is eligible, it always becomes the master
branch.
* If an element of the branchify set ends with `+/*+`, it is considered
a branch namespace: each immediate subdirectory of it is considered a
potential branch, unless it itself appears in branchify as a namespace
If `*` is in the branchify set (which is true by default) all top-level
directories are also considered potential branches (other than `/trunk`
which is mapped to master, `/tags`, and `/branches` which are namespaces
by default).

* Files in the top-level directory are assigned to a synthetic branch
named '```root```'. If there is no "trunk" (or rather no master branch), then
this synthetic '```root```' branch becomes the master branch. You can map
another directory to master using `branchify` and `branchmap`.

* Each potential branch is checked to see if it has commits on it
after the initial creation or copy.  If there are such commits, or if the
branch creation or copy introduces changes other than the copy, it
becomes a branch.  If not, it may become a tag in order to preserve
the commit metadata. In all cases, the name of any created tag or
branch is the basename of the directory, unless another mapping is
in place.

Branch-creation operations with no following commits are tagified.

Otherwise, each commit that only creates or deletes directories
(in particular, copy commits for tags and branches, and commits that
only change properties) will be transformed into a tag named after the
tag or branch, containing the date/author/comment metadata from the
commit.

Subversion branch deletions are turned into deletealls, clearing the
fileset of the import-stream branch.  When a branch
finishes with a deleteall at its tip, the deleteall is transformed
into a tag. This rule cleans up after aborted branch renames.

Occasionally (and usually by mistake) a branchy Subversion
repository will contain revisions that touch multiple branches. These
are handled by partitioning them into multiple import-stream commits,
one on each affected branch. The Legacy-ID of such a split commit
will have a pseudo-decimal part - for example, if Subversion revision 2317
touches three branches, the three generated commits will have IDs
2317.1, 2317.2, and 2317.3.

The `svn:executable` and `svn:special` properties are translated
into permission settings in the input stream; `svn:executable` becomes
100755 and `svn:special` becomes 120000 (indicating a symlink; the blob
contents will be the path to which the symlink should resolve).

Any `cvs2svn:rev` properties generated by
`cvs2svn` are incorporated into the internal map
used for reference-lifting, then discarded.

Normally, per-directory `svn:ignore` properties become _.gitignore_ files.
Actual _.gitignore_ files in a Subversion directory are presumed to have
been created by git-svn users separately from native Subversion ignore
properties and discarded with a warning. It is up to the user to merge
the content of such files into the target repository by hand.  But
this behavior is changed by the `--user-ignores` option which disables
filtering of in-tree _.gitignore_ files, and the `--no-automatic-ignores`
which discards Subversion `svn:ignore` properties without translation.

Normally, _.cvsignore_ files left over from a Subversion repository's
ancient history as a CVS repository are deleted. The assumption is
that the repository users want the (presumably more up-to-date)
Subversion ignore properties to be translated.  However, this
deletion can be prevented with the `--cvsignores` read option.

`svn:mergeinfo` properties are interpreted.  Any `svn:mergeinfo` property on a
revision A with a merge source containing all revisions on a branch from the
forking point (or the branch start if the histories are independent) up to
revision B produces a merge link such that the branch tip at revision B becomes
a parent of A.
The "svnmerge-integrated" properties produced by Subversion's svnmerge.py script
are handled the same way.

All other Subversion properties are discarded. (This may change in a
future release.) The property for which this is most likely to cause
semantic problems is `svn:eol-style`. However, since property-change-only
commits get turned into annotated tags, the translated tags will retain
information about setting changes.

The sub-second resolution on Subversion commit dates is discarded;
Git wants integer timestamps only.

Because fast-import format cannot represent an empty directory,
empty directories in Subversion repositories will be lost in
translation.

Normally, Subversion local usernames are mapped in the style of
`git cvs-import`; thus user '```foo```' becomes '```foo <foo>```', which is
sufficient to pacify git and other systems that require email
addresses.  With the option `svn_use_uuid`, usernames are mapped in the
`git-svn` style, with the repository's UUID used as a fake domain in the
email address. Both forms can be remapped to real address using
the `authors read` command.

Reading a Subversion stream enables writing of the legacy map as
'legacy-id' passthroughs when the repo is written to a stream
file.

reposurgeon tries hard to silently do the right thing, but there are
Subversion edge cases in which it emits warnings because a human may
need to intervene and perform fixups by hand. Here are the less
obvious messages it may emit:

user-created .gitignore ignored::
   This message means means reposurgeon has
   found a _.gitignore_ file in the Subversion
   repository it is analyzing. This probably happened because somebody
   was using `git-svn` as a live gateway, and created
   ignores which may or may not be congruent with those in the generated
   _.gitignore_ files that the Subversion ignore
   properties will be translated into.  You'll need to make a policy
   decision about which set of ignores to use in the conversion, and
   possibly set the `--user-ignores` option on read to pass through
   user-created _.gitignore_ files; in that case this
   warning will not be emitted.

properties set::
   reposurgeon has detected a setting of a
   user-defined property, or the Subversion properties
   `svn:externals`. These properties cannot be expressed in an import
   stream; the user is notified in case this is a showstopper for the
   conversion or some corrective action is required, but normally this
   error can be ignored.  This warning is suppressed by the
   `--ignore-properties` option.

Detected link from <__revision__> to <__revision__> might be dubious::
   When trying to detect parent links from multiple file copies like what
   `cvs2svn` can produce, source revisions of the different copies were not
   all the same. The link should probably be monitored because it has a
   non-negligible probability of being slightly wrong. This does not impact
   the tree contents, only the quality of the history.

[[branchification]]
=== Branchification

This is

`branchify` [ _path-set_ ]::
   Specify the list of directories to be treated as potential
   branches (to become tags if there are no modifications after the
   creation copies) when analyzing a Subversion repo. This list is
   ignored when the '```--nobranch```' `read` option is used.  It
   defaults to the 'standard layout' set of directories, plus any
   unrecognized directories in the repository root.
+
String quotes and backslash
escapes are interpreted when parsing the command line.
+
With no arguments, displays the current branchification set.
+
An asterisk at the end of a path in the set means '`__all immediate
subdirectories of this path, unless they are part of another (longer)
path in the branchify set__`'.
+
Note that the branchify set is a property of the reposurgeon
interpreter, not of any individual repository, and will persist across
Subversion dumpfile reads. This may lead to unexpected results if you
forget to re-set it.

`branchmap` [ _/regex/branch/_... | `reset` ] ::
   Specify the list of regular expressions used for mapping the SVN
   branches that are detected by `branchify`. If none of the expressions
   match the default behavior applies. This maps a branch to the name
   of the last directory, except for `trunk` and `*` which are
   mapped to `master` and `root`.
+
With no arguments the current regex replacement pairs are
shown. Passing '```reset```' will clear the mapping.
+
String quotes and backslash escapes are *not* interpreted when parsing
the command line, this would clash with the use of backslashes as
substitution-part references. If you need to include a non-printing
character in a regexp, use its C-style escape, e.g. `\s` for space.
+
The `branchify` command will match each branch name against _regex1_
and if it matches rewrite its branch name to _branch1_. If not it will
try _regex2_ and so forth until it either found a matching regex or
there are no regexes left. The branch name can use Go
backreferences.
+
Note that the regular expressions are appended to '```refs/```'
without either the needed '```heads/```' or '```tags/```'. This allows for
choosing the right kind of branch type.
+
While the syntax template above uses slashes, any first character will
be used as a delimiter (and you will need to use a different one in the
common case that the paths contain slashes).
+
You must give this command _before_ the
Subversion repository read it is supposed to affect!  This will not
affect any other repository type.
+
Note that the branchmap set is a property of the reposurgeon
interpreter, not of any individual repository, and will persist across
Subversion dumpfile or repository reads. This may lead to unexpected
results if you forget to re-set it.

[[midbranch]]
=== Mid-branch deletions

When a branch A is deleted and a branch B is copied to the name A, the
Subversion intent is to replace the contents of branch A with the
contents of branch B, keeping the A name.  This is a poor man's merge
from before "svn merge" existed. Many Subversion users who formed
their habits before svn merge existed still operate this way.

In git terms, this almost corresponds to a merge of A into B
followed by a rename of B to A.  Branch B continues to exist, however,
so we can't do that in translation.  The
reposurgeon logic does not try to be clever about this,
because "clever" would have rebarbative edge cases; the sequence is
translated into a deleteall followed by a commit operation that
recreates the B files under corresponding A names. No merge link is
created. The commit filling A with a branch copy from B will have
B as its first parent, though, so all that would be needed is to create
a merge link from the old A before the delete to the commit recreating A.

This case is mentioned here because it is likely to confuse
the merge-tracking algorithms used, e.g., by `git diff`, or if you ever
try to merge a branch that forked off the old A to a branch spun off the new
(and expect git to know that you do not want to incorporate old A's changes).

[[multiproject]]
=== Multiproject Subversion repositories

Subversion repositories are sometimes organized to hold multiple
projects, with the root directory containing one subdirectory per
project and each subdirectory having its own trunk/branches/tags
layout.

Suppose you have a stream dump from a repository with two project
subdirectories, project1 and project2.  The pattern for dissecting out
project1 looks like this:

--------
branchify project1/trunk project1/branches/* project1/tags *
branchmap :project1/trunk:heads/master: :project1/tags:tags: :project1/branches:branches:
set testmode
read <multiproject.svn
branch project2 delete
--------

The first command branchifies every directory underneath project1 for
which that's required, with project2 left as its own branch from top
level. The second command sets up a transform of these branches into a
standard layout.

These transformations are performed when the actual read of the
repository happens.  Following that, the unneeded project2 branch can
be dropped.

Of course we could have done the same thing with project2 and dropped
project1.  Repeat this as many times as required to turn each partial
into an autonomous git repository.

While something like this could be done with repocutter sift
commands, that would not correctly resolve Subversion copies across
projects.  This reposurgeon procedure handles those correctly.

[[CVS]]
== Working with CVS

When you are lifting a CVS repository using reposurgeon, most of the
heavy lifting will have been done by the importer - cvs-fast-export.
In particular, it coalesces CVS per-file changes into changesets when
it detects that they have identical comments and attributions and are
close in time, and it converts .cvsignore files to .gitignores.

One issue to keep an eye on is whether the window defining "close in
time" is wide enough.  If it's not, you may detect commit groups with
the same committer and comment text that should have been merged into
one changeset but were not.  You can either clean these up with the
'```coalesce```' command in reposurgeon or run cvs-fast-export by hand
with a larger -w option and read in the generated stream. 

One step in cleaning up a CVS conversion that is unique to that
system is deleting root tags - tags which have "-root" as a name
suffix and mark the beginning of a branch,  CVS uses these for
bookeeping, but later sysrems don't need them.  They're just
clutter and can be removed.

It's also worth paying careful attention to reference-lifting so that
you can scrub useless CVS revision numbers out of comments.  This is a
more pressing issue than it is with Subversion, where changesrtts map
tp changesets and conversions have the option of marking each target
changeset with its revision number.

[[troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting and bug reports

[[oom]]
=== Dealing with memory exhaustion

To do its job, reposurgeon needs to hold all of your history's metadata
in memory. That doesn't mean the content part, but does mean all of
the changeset attributions, comments, and tags.  Given a large enough
repository, this will overrun the RAM of a small machine. If this
happens to you, your reposurgeon instance will die abruptly with an
OOM (Out Of Memory) error while attempting to read in your repository.

It is extremely unlikely that this is due to a bug in reposurgeon.
Before filing an issue about it, there is a procedure you should try.
It consists of bisecting on the parameter the Go language runtime
uses to control the frequency of garbage collection.  You can set this
using the environment variable GOGC or reposurgeon "gc" command.

GOGC defaults to 100, which instructs the runtime to garbage-collect
when the heap size is 100% bigger than (i.e., twice) the size of the
reachable objects after the last garbage collection.  To increase the
frequency of GC, usually resulting in a lower memory high-water mark,
decrease that percentage threshold.  To decrease gc frequency, increase
the threshold so the runtime tolerates a larger heap. 

To troubleshoot your OOM problem, bisect on this threshold to find
the highest value that will avoid OOM.  Start by cutting it to 50,
then to 25, then to 12, then to 6.  If you find a value that allows
you to read to completion, you may want to try increasing it by
a half interval (e,g. 50 to 75, 25 to 37, etc.) to get back some
throughput.

If your repository won't read in at GOGC=6 you have a real problem.
Unfortunately, it's not one the reposurgeon devteam can help you
with; the correct solution to it is to do your conversion on a machine
with more RAM.  64GB should be sufficient.  The largest repository
the reposurgeon devteam has ever seen (the history of GCC, 280K
Subversion commits) fit on a 128GB machine with GOGC=30.

If you can't read your history onto a 128GB machine with GOGC=30,
*then* maybe the reposurgeon devteam ought to hear about it. That
said, if you can find ways to make reposurgeon more efficient, we are
eager to accept those patches, or even just a bug report with the
details. It's probable that there are some efficiency gains yet to be
made.

=== How to report bugs

reposurgeon is an extremely algorithmically complex program.  It may
still have bugs when dealing with strange corner cases in older
repositories.

It is often extremely difficult or impossible to reproduce those bugs
without a copy of the history on which they occurred. When you find a
bug, please send me:

(a) An exact description of how observed behavior differed from expected
behavior.  If reposurgeon died, include the backtrace.

(b) A git fast-import or Subversion dump file of the repository you
were operating on, or a pointer to where I can pull it from. 

(c) A script containing the sequence of reposurgeon commands that
revealed the bug.

Please use the reposurgeon project's issue tracker and attach these
files. It's helpful.

==== Test case reduction

If you know how to reproduce the error, the best possible test case
is a hand-crafted repository of minimal size with content that
explains how it breaks the tool. I turn these into regression tests
instantly. 

When you don't know the cause of the error, ship me a dump file
derived from the real repository that triggered it.  To speed up my
debugging process so you can get an answer more quickly, there are
some tactics you can use to reduce the bulk of the test case you send
me. Also, a well-reduced dump can become a regression test to ensure
the bug does not recur.

How to make dumps in Git: cd to your git repository and capture the
output of "repotool export".

How to make dumps in Subversion: cd to the toplevel directory of the
repository master - not a checkout of it, you can tell you're
in the right place if you see this:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ls
conf  db  format  hooks  locks  README.txt
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Then run "repotool export", capturing the output.

The commands you will use for test-case reduction are reposurgeon and,
on Subversion dumps, repocutter.

==== Replace the content blobs in the dump with stubs

The subcommand in both tools is 'strip'; it will usually cut the size
of the dump by more than a factor of 10. Check that the bug still
reproduces on the stripped dump; if it doesn't, that would be
unprecedented and interesting in itself.

If you are trying to maintain confidentiality about your code, sending
me a stripped repo has the additional advantage that I won't see the code!
The command preserves structure and metadata but replaces each content
blob with a unique magic cookie.

==== Truncate the dump as much as possible

Try to truncate the dump to the shortest leading section that
reproduces the bug.

A reposurgeon error message will normally include a mark, event
number, or (when reading a Subversion dump) a Subversion revision
number.  Use a selection-set argument to reposurgeon's 'write'
command, or the 'select' subcommand of repocutter, to pare down the
dump so that it ends just after the error is triggered.  Again, check
to ensure that the bug reproduces on the truncated dump.

If the error message doesn't tell you where the problem occurred, try
a bisection process.  Use the --readlimit option of the read to ignore
the last half of the events in the dump; check to see if the bug
reproduces.  If it does, repeat; it it does not, throw out the last
quarter, then the last eighth, and so forth.  Keep this up until you
can no longer drop events without making the bug go away.

Bisection is more effective than you might expect, because the kinds
of repository malformations that trigger misbehavior from reposurgeon
tend to rise in frequency as you go back in time. The largest single
category of them has been ancient cruft produced by cvs2svn conversions.

==== Topologically reduce the dump

Next, topologically reduce the dump, throwing out boring commits that are
unlikely to be related to your problem. 

If a commit has all file modifications (no additions or deletions or
copies or renames) and has exactly one ancestor and one descendant,
then it may be boring. In a Subversion dump it also has to not have
any property changes; in a git dump it must not be referred to by any
tag or reset.  Interesting commits are not boring, or have a
not-boring parent or not-boring child. 

Try using the 'reduce' subcommand of repocutter to strip boring commits
out of a Subversion dump. For a git dump, look at "strip reduce".

==== Prune irrelevant branches

Try to throw away branches that are not relevant to your problem.  The
'expunge' operation on repocutter or the 'branch delete' command in 
reposurgeon may be helpful.  

This is the attempted simplification least unlikely to make your bug
vanish, so check that carefully after each branch deletion.

=== Know how to spot possible importer bugs

If your target VCS's importer dies during a rebuild, try writing the
repository content to a stream instead and importing the stream by
hand.  If the latter does not fail, the target VCS's importer may be
slightly buggy - but you have a workaround.

(This has been observed under git 2.5.0 with the result of a unite
operation on two repositories. The cause is unknown, as git dies
suddenly enough to not leave a crash report.)

=== Benchmarking

A fair amount of effort has been expended to keep the run-time
performance of Reposurgeon as linear as possible. This is not an easy
state to stay in; it is unfortunately quite simple to accidentally
regress this without noticing.

To that end, there are some fairly simple scripts in the bench
directory of the source distribution that can be used to check for
this type of problem. `bench.sh` runs reposurgeon multiple times with
a different readlimit each time, recording the run time and memory
allocated at each iteration. Supply arguments specifying the dump file
to read and the readlimit values to use like this:

    ./bench/bench.sh your-dump-file.svn 1000 2000 20000

This reads `your-dump-file.svn` 10 times, with the readlimit set first
to 1,000, then 3,000, etc, stepping up until it reaches 20,000.

This produces a `.dat` file which you can use with `plot.sh`,
`svg.sh`, or `compare.sh` to produce graphs.

For an example, see `link:bench/oops.svg[bench/oops.svg]`. This shows
a graph made using good revision that had linear performance, several
made with revisions that introduced a regression that made performance
quite non-linear, and the fix. You can easily tell the difference
visually.

[[changes]]
=== Incompatible language changes

In versions before 3.23, '```prefer```' changed the
repository type as well as the preferred output format.

In versions before 3.0, the general command syntax put the
command verb first, then the selection set (if any) then modifiers
(VSO).  It has changed to optional selection set first, then command
verb, then modifiers (SVO). The change made parsing simpler, allowed
abolishing some noise keywords, and recapitulates a successful design
pattern in some other Unix tools - notably
sed(1).

In versions before 3.0, path expressions only matched
commits, not commits and the associated blobs as well. The names
of the "a" and "c" flags were different.

In reposurgeon versions before 3.0, the delete command had the
semantics of squash; also, the policy flags did not require a '```--```'
prefix. The '```--delete```' flag was named "obliterate".

In reposurgeon versions before 3.0, `read` and
`write` optionally took file arguments rather than requiring redirects
(and the `write` command never wrote into directories). This was changed
in order to allow these commands to have modifiers. These modifiers
replaced several global options that no longer exist.

In reposurgeon versions before 3.0, the earliest factor in a `unite`
command always kept its tag and branch names unaltered. The new rule
for resolving name conflicts, giving priority to the latest factor,
produces more natural behavior when uniting two repositories end to
end; the master branch of the second (later) one keeps its name.

In reposurgeon versions before 3.0, the `tagify`
command expected policies as trailing arguments to alter its behavior. The new
syntax uses similarly named options with leading dashes, that can appear
anywhere after the `tagify` command.

In versions before 2.9. the syntax of `authors`, `legacy`, `list`, and
what are now `msg{in|out}` was different (and `legacy` was
`fossils`). They took plain filename arguments rather than using
redirect < and >.

In versions before 4.0, `msgin` and `msgout` were named "mailbox_in"
and "mailbox_out:"; `branchify` was "branchify_map". Previous
versions used the Python variant of regular expressions; some of
the more idiosyncratic features of these are not replicated in the
Go implementation.

In versions before 4.1, the `index` command did not see blobs by default.

[[emergency]]
=== Emergency help

If you need emergency help, go to the #reposurgeon IRC on freenode.
Be aware, however, that the maintainer is too busy to babysit
difficult repository conversions unless he has explicitly volunteered
for one or someone is paying him to care about it.  For explanation,
see http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=5087[Your money or your spec].

[[extensions]]
== Stream syntax extensions

The event-stream parser in `reposurgeon` supports some extended
syntax. Exporters designed to work with `reposurgeon` may have a
`--reposurgeon` option that enables emission of extended syntax;
notably, this is true of cvs-fast-export(1).  The remainder of this
section describes these syntax extensions.  The properties they set
are (usually) preserved and re-output when the stream file is written.

The token '```#reposurgeon```' at the start of a comment line in a
fast-import stream signals reposurgeon that the remainder is an
extension command to be interpreted by `reposurgeon`.

One such extension command is implemented: '```sourcetype```', which
behaves identically to the reposurgeon `sourcetype` command. An
exporter for a version-control system named "frobozz" could, for
example, say

--------
#reposurgeon sourcetype frobozz
--------

Within a commit, a magic comment of the form '```#legacy-id```' declares a
legacy ID from the stream file's source version-control system.

Also accepted is the bzr syntax for setting per-commit
properties. While parsing commit syntax, a line beginning with the
token '```property```' must continue with a whitespace-separated
property-name token. If it is then followed by a newline it is taken
to set that boolean-valued property to true. Otherwise it must be
followed by a numeric token specifying a data length, a space,
following data (which may contain newlines) and a terminating
newline. For example:

--------
commit refs/heads/master
mark :1
committer Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com> 1289147634 -0500
data 16
Example commit.

property legacy-id 2 r1
M 644 inline README
--------

Unlike other extensions, bzr properties are only preserved on
stream output if the preferred type is bzr, because any importer other
than bzr's will choke on them.

[[limitations]]
== Limitations and guarantees

Guarantee: In DVCSes that use commit hashes, editing with reposurgeon
never changes the hash of a commit object unless (a) you edit the
commit, or (b) it is a descendant of an edited commit in a VCS that
includes parent hashes in the input of a child object's hash (git and
hg both do this).

Guarantee: reposurgeon only requires main memory proportional to the
size of a repository's metadata history, not its entire content
history. (Exception: the data from inline content is held in memory.)

Guarantee: In the worst case, reposurgeon makes its own copy of every
content blob in the repository's history and thus uses intermediate
disk space approximately equal to the size of a repository's content
history. However, when the repository to be edited is presented as a
stream file, reposurgeon requires no or only very little extra disk
space to represent it; the internal representation of content blobs is
a (seek-offset, length) pair pointing into the stream file.

Guarantee: reposurgeon never modifies the contents of a repository it
reads, nor deletes any repository. The results of surgery are always
expressed in a new repository.

Guarantee: Any line in a fast-import stream that is not a part of a
command reposurgeon parses and understands will be passed through
unaltered.  At present the set of potential passthroughs is known to
include the `progress`, `options`, and `checkpoint` commands as
well as comments led by `#`.

Guarantee: All reposurgeon operations either preserve all repository
state they are not explicitly told to modify or warn you when they
cannot do so.

Guarantee: reposurgeon handles the bzr commit-properties extension,
correctly passing through property items including those with embedded
newlines. (Such properties are also editable in the message-box
format.)

Limitation: Because reposurgeon relies on other programs to generate
and interpret the fast-import command stream, it is subject to bugs in
those programs.

Limitation: bzr suffers from deep confusion over whether its unit of
work is a repository or a floating branch that might have been cloned
from a repo or created from scratch, and might or might not be
destined to be merged to a repo one day. Its exporter only works on
branches, but its importer creates repos.  Thus, a rebuild operation
will produce a subdirectory structure that differs from what you
expect.  Look for your content under the subdirectory '```trunk```'.

Limitation: under git, signed tags are imported verbatim. However, any
operation that modifies any commit upstream of the target of the
tag will invalidate it.

Limitation: Stock git (at least as of version 1.7.3.2) will choke on
property extension commands. Accordingly, reposurgeon
omits them when rebuilding a repo with git type.

Limitation: Converting an hg repo that uses bookmarks (not
branches) to git can lose information; the branch ref that git assigns
to each commit may not be the same as the hg bookmark that was active
when the commit was originally made under hg.  Unfortunately, this is
a real ontological mismatch, not a problem that can be fixed by
cleverness in reposurgeon.

Limitation: Converting an hg repo that uses branches to git can
lose information because git does not store an explicit branch as part
of commit metadata, but colors commits with branch or tag names on the
fly using a specific coloring algorithm, which might not match the explicit
branch assignments to commits in the original hg repo. Reposurgeon
preserves the hg branch information when reading an hg repo, so it is
available from within reposurgeon itself, but there is no way to preserve
it if the repo is written to git.

Limitation: Not all BitKeeper versions have the fast-import and
fast-export commands that reposurgeon requires.
They are present back to the 7.3 opensource version.

Limitation: reposurgeon may misbehave under a filesystem which smashes
case in filenames, or which nominally preserves case but maps names
differing only by case to the same filesystem node (Mac OS X behaves
like this by default).  Problems will arise if any two paths in a repo
differ by case only. To avoid the problem on a Mac, do all your
surgery on an HFS+ file system formatted with case sensitivity
specifically enabled.

Limitation: If whitespace followed by `#` appears in a string or
regexp command argument, it will be misinterpreted as the beginning of
a line-ending comment and screw up parsing.

Guarantee: As version-control systems add support for the
fast-import format, their repositories will become editable by
reposurgeon.

[appendix]
== The ontological-mismatch problem and its consequences

There are many tools for converting repositories between
version-control systems out there. This appendix explains why
reposurgeon is the best of breed by comparing it to the
competition.

The problems other repository-translation tools have come from
ontological mismatches between their source and target systems -
models of changesets, branching and tagging can differ in complicated
ways. While these gaps can often be bridged by careful analysis, the
techniques for doing so are algorithmically complex, difficult to
test, and have ugly edge cases.

Furthermore, doing a really high-quality translation often requires
human judgment about how to move artifacts - and what to discard.
But most lifting tools are, unlike reposurgeon, designed as
run-it-once batch processors that can only implement simple
and mechanical rules.

Consequently, most repository-translation tools evade the harder
problems. They produce a sort of pidgin rendering that crudely and
partially copies the history from the source system to the target
without fully translating it into native idioms, leaving behind
metadata that would take more effort to move over or leaving it in
the native format for the source system.

But pidgin repository translations are a kind of friction drag on future
development, and are just plain unpleasant to use.  So instead of evading
the hard problems, reposurgeon provides a power assist for a human
to tackle them head-on.

Here are some specific symptoms of evasion that are common enough to
deserve tags for later reference.

LINEAR: One very common form of evasion is only handling linear
histories.

NO_IGNORES: There are many different mechanisms for ignoring files -
.cvsignore, Subversion svn:ignore properties, .gitignore and their
analogues. Many older Subversion repositories still have .cvsignore
files in them as relics of CVS prehistory that weren't translated when
the repository was lifted.  Reposurgeon, on the other hand, knows
these can be changed to .gitignore files and does it.

NO_TAGS: Many repository translators cannot generate annotated tags
(or their non-git equivalents) even when that would be the right
abstraction in the target system.

CONFIGURATION: Another common failing is for repository-translation
tools to require a lot of configuration and ceremony before they can
operate.  Often, for example, tools that translate from Subversion
repositories require you to declare the repository's branch structure
every time even though sensible defaults and a bit of autodetection
could have avoided this.

MIXEDBRANCH: Yet another case usually handled poorly (in translators
that handle branching) is mixed-branch commits. In Subversion it is
possible (though a bad idea) to commit a changeset that modifies
multiple branches at once.  All sufficiently old Subversion
repositories have these, often by accident.  The proper thing to do
is split these up; the usual thing is to assign them to one branch
and leave them omitted from the others.

Version references in commit comments.  It is not uncommon to see a
lot of references that are no longer usable embedded in translated
repositories like fossils in geological strata - file-version numbers
like '1.2' in Subversion repos that had a former life in CVS,
Subversion references like 'r1234' in git repositories, and so forth.
There's no tag for this because tools other than reposurgeon generally
have no support at all for lifting these.

To avoid repetitive text in these descriptions, I use the following
additional bug tags:

CONFIGURATION: Requires elaborate configuration even for cases that
ought to be simple.

ABANDONED: Effectively abandoned by its maintainer. Some tools with
this tag are still nominally maintained but have not been updated
or released in years.

NO_DOCUMENTATION: Poorly (if at all) documented.

!FOO means the tool is known not to have problem FOO.

?FOO means I have not tried the tool but have strong reason to
suspect the problem is present based on other things I know about it.

You should assume that none of these tools do reference-lifting.

=== cvs2svn

http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/features.html

Just after the turn of the 21st century, when Subversion was the
new thing in version control, most projects that were using version
control were using CVS, and cvs2svn was about the only migration path.

Early cvs2svn had problems on every level, only some of which have
been fixed by more recent releases. It tended to spew junk commits
into the translated history, and produced strange combinations of
Subversion internal operations that most later translation tools would
cope with only poorly. Sometimes the resulting translations are
actually malformed; more often they contains noisy commits or commit
duplications that made little sense under Subversion and make even
less under the new target system.

!LINEAR, ?MIXEDBRANCH, DOCUMENTATION

=== cvs-fast-export

http://www.catb.org/~esr/cvs-fast-export

Formerly named parsecvs. Originally written by Keith Packard to port
the X.org repositories, which it did a good job on.  Now maintained by
me; reposurgeon uses it to read CVS repositories.  It is *extremely*
fast and can thus be productively used even on huge repositories.

!ABANDONED, !LINEAR, !NO_IGNORES, !DOCUMENTATION, !CONFIGURATION

=== cvsps

http://www.catb.org/~esr/cvsps

Don't use this.  Just plain don't.  I maintained version 3.x until I
end-of-lifed it in favor of cvs-fast-export due to fundamental,
unfixable problems.  It gets branch topology wrong in ways that are
difficult to detect.

=== git-svn

git-svn, the Subversion converter in the git distribution, is really
designed to be a two-way live gateway enabling git users to push and
pull commits from a Subversion server.  It operates by creating a
git repository that is effectively a local mirror of the Subversion
history, then performing Subversion client commands to synchronize
the two in a git-like way.

This choice of mission means that git-svn's translation of history
into git uses a compromise between Subversion idioms and git ones that
is more designed to make transactions back to the Subversion server
easy and safe to generate than it is to make full use of the git
capabilities that Subversion doesn't have.  This is pidgin translation
for a reason better than laziness or failure of nerve, but it's still
pidgin.

Worse, git-svn has bugs that severely compromise it for full
translations.  It tends to stumble over common repository
malformations in Subversion, producing history damage that is
significant but evades superficial scrutiny.  I have written about
this problem in detail at http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=6778[Don't do
svn-to-git repository conversions with git-svn!]

For a straight linear history with no tags or branches, the difference
between git-svn's Subversion-emulating behavior and the way a git
repository would most naturally be structured is minimal.  But for
conformability with Subversion, git-svn cannot (practically speaking)
use git's annotated-tag facility in the local mirror; instead,
Subversion tags have to be represented in the local mirror as git
branches even if they have no changes after the initial branch copy.

Another thing the live-gatewaying use case prevents is
reference-lifting.  Subversion references like "r1234" in commit
comments have to be left as-is to avoid creating pain for users of the
same Subversion remote not going through git-svn.

git-svn was used by both Google Code's exporter and is used GitHub importer
web services.  Depending on the latter is not recommended.

!ABANDONED, MIXEDBRANCH, NO_TAGS, NO_IGNORES.

=== git-svnimport

Formerly part of the git suite; what they had before git-svn, and inferior to
it.  Among other problems, it can only handle Subversion repos with
a "standard" trunk/tags/branches layout. Now deprecated.

MIXEDBRANCH, NO_TAGS, NO_IGNORES, ABANDONED.

=== git-svn-import

https://github.com/stevenharman/git-svn-import

A trivial wrapper around git-svn.  All the reasons not to use git-svn
apply to it as well.

MIXEDBRANCH, NO_TAGS, NO_IGNORES, !ABANDONED.

=== svn-fe

https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/contrib/svn-fe

svn-fe was a valiant effort to produce a tool that would dump a
Subversion repository history as a git fast-import stream.  It
made it into the git contrib directory and lingers there still.

LINEAR, NO_TAGS, NO_IGNORES, ABANDONED.

=== Tailor

http://progetti.arstecnica.it/tailor/

Tailor aimed to be an any-to-any repository translator.

LINEAR, ?NO_IGNORES, ABANDONED.

=== agito

https://github.com/fragglet/agito

This is a Subversion-to-git tool that was written to handle some
cases that git-svn barfs on (but reposurgeon doesn't - the reposurgeon
test suite contains a case sent by agito's author to check this).
It even handles mixed-branch commits correctly.

!LINEAR, !NO_TAGS, !MIXEDBRANCH, CONFIGURATION.

If you cannot use reposurgeon for some reason, this is one of
the best alternatives.

=== svn2git (jcoglan/nirvdrum version)

https://github.com/nirvdrum/svn2git

A batch-conversion wrapper around git-svn that creates real tag
objects. This is the one written in Ruby.  Has all pf git-svn's
problems, alas.

!ABANDONED, !NO_TAGS, NO_IGNORES.

If you cannot use reposurgeon for some reason, this is another
alternative that is not too horrible. But beware of possible
history damage if your Subversion repo has malformations that
confuse git-svn.

=== svn2git (Schemenauer version)

http://python.ca/nas/python/svn2git.py

Native Python. More a proof of concept than a production tool.

LINEAR, NO_TAGS, NO_IGNORES, NO_DOCUMENTATION, ABANDONED.

=== svn2git (Nyblom version)

http://gitorious.org/svn2git

Written in C++.  Says it's based on svn-fast-export by Chris Lee.  Not
easy to figure out what it actually does, as there is no documentation
at all and no test cases.  May be genetically related to
svn-all-fast-export, but if so they diverged in 2008.

=== svn-dump-fast-export

https://github.com/barrbrain/svn-dump-fast-export/

Written in C.  Documentation is so lacking that
there isn't even a README.  However, it's
possible to deduce what isn't there by
reading the code.

LINEAR, NO_TAGS, NO_IGNORES, NO_DOCUMENTATION.

===  svn-all-fast-export

http://repo.or.cz/w/svn-all-fast-export.git

May be genetically related to the Nyblom svn2git, but if so they
diverged in 2008.

LINEAR, NO_TAGS, NO_IGNORES, NO_DOCUMENTATION, ABANDONED.

=== SubGit

http://www.subgit.com/

Nearly unique for this category of software in being closed-source.  Beyond
an evaluation period, users have to register, possibly for a cost
(it's supposed to be free-of-charge for certain uses: open source
projects, education, and ``startups'' -- history with BitKeeper shows
that these arrangements should not be trusted).

The intended outcome of this program is to provide a server with
support for both Subversion and Git users to interact at once.  This
may be of little value overall, as new developers are frequently
unfamiliar with Subversion (and old ones forget the usage patterns!),
fundamental differences in design of the two VCSes interfering with
the quality of both views, and increased confusion with preferred
modes of contribution arise.

The quality of SubGit's conversion is rather poor. It fails to
properly translate at least half of the reposurgeon *.svn regression
tests, even some of the simpler ones - although trickier cases such as
agito.svn it does translates correctly.  Large real-world Subversion repos
will exhibit multiple issues that SubGit may, silently or otherwise,
trip over.

This program will forever contain compromises for the same reasons
git-svn does.  The non-open source nature leaves little hope of having
such issues repaired by skilled community members.

Atlassian's BitBucket service relies on this for Subversion-to-Git
migration.  Depending on this service is not recommended.

!MIXEDBRANCH, !LINEAR, CONFIGURATION, DOCUMENTATION

[appendix]
== Reposurgeon success stories

Reposurgeon has been used for successful conversion on projects
including but not limited to the following.  These are in rough
chronological order.

Hercules (IBM mainframe emulator)::
	 The author did this one, Subversion to hg. About ten years of history
	 at the time, not too horribly messy.

NUT (Network UPS Tools)::
	The author did this one, Subversion to git. The trial by fire - it was
	when the Subversion dump analyzer got built. Very large old
	repository with lots of pathologies (there was a CVS stratum).

Battle For Wesnoth::
	The author did this one, Subversion to git. Very large repo, moderately complex.

Roundup (issue tracker)::
	The author this one, Subversion to git (they later switched to
	hg). Moderate-sized Subversion repo with some very strange
	malformations.

robotfindskitten::
	The author did this one, CVS to git.  Simple history, pretty easy.

Blender::
	Two guys at Blender did this one with help from the author, Subversion
	to git. Huge repository with a lot of nasty pathologies.  The
	tool needed some serious optimization and feature upgrades
	to handle it.

groff::
	The author did this one, CVS to git.  Rather easy as the project
	history was almost linear and, though very old, not huge.

Nethack::
	CVS to git. This conversion has not yet been publicly released
	at time of writing (late October 2014) for complicated
	political reasons.

Emacs::
	A record three layers, Bazaar over CVS over RCS.
	Malformations not too bad except for some unique challenges
	created by the RCS-to-CVS conversion, but the sheer size of
	the history and number of layers makes it the most complex
	conversion yet. Converted in 2011.

ntp::
	The author did this, BitKeeper to git using a derivative of Tridge's SourcePuller
	as a front end, done in early 2015.  Nothing especially taxing
	about the reposurgeon side of things, the magic was all in the
	front end.

pdfrw, playtag, pyeda, rson::
       Four small Subversion projects by Patrick Maupin, converted in
       two hours' work in May 2015.  No significant difficulties.
       These mainly served to demonstrate that the standard conversion
       workflow in conversion.mk is fast and effective for a wide
       range of projects.

mh-e::
	The Emacs interface for MH.  Converted by Bill Wohler in late 2015.
        He reports that the standard conversion workflow worked fine.

GNUPLOT::
	CVS to git, 30 years of history with some early releases recovered
	from tarballs. Converted by the author in late 2017. Somewhat messy due to
	vendor-branch issues.

GCC::
	SVN to git, with ancient strata of CVS and RCS. 280K commits of
	history back to 1987, dwarfing Emacs. Converted by myself and
	two core GCC developers. The 4.0 release came out of this.
	Final cutover was on Jan 12th 2020.
