* Weird combinations of Subversion copy-delete operations can produce
  content-mismatch failures detectable by repotool compare. In the test
  suite, this problem is exhibited by agito.svn, fleetwood.svn, and
  references.svn.

* Propagation of execute permission in Subversion translations seems flawed.

* Some attempt should be made to create marge links when a deletall is followed
  by a directory copy from another branch. (This is what triggers the "mid-branch
  delete" warning, which should ideally go away.)

* Can gitspace merges be deduced from svk:merge and svnmerge properties?

* Also see https://gitlab.com/esr/reposurgeon/issues for two minor problems.

* The toposort code is back in, but the calls to the resort() function
  in the reorder and reoarent commands have been commented out in both
  Go and Python. The Python version works, the Go version neefs
  fixing. There's a commented-out section documenting toposort,

* repocutter renumber needs a test that demonstates patching of
  Node-copyfrom-rev fields.

* repocutter needs to patch mergeinfo revisions.

* Restore the ability to work with discontinuous revision sequences.
  Can be tested with a version of swap.svn from before 2019-09-22.

* After the above is done, bring back the too-many-parents.svn test
  from before 2019-09-22 (has both discontinuous revisions and
  mergeinfo properties).

* Fix up generation of R and C in the Mercurial exporter.
