== Known bugs ==

* Weird combinations of Subversion tag creation followed by tag delete
  and renaming operations can produce content-mismatch failures
  detectable by repotool compare. In the test suite, this problem is
  exhibited by branchreplace.svn, emptyfrom.svn, references.svn.
  Run "make listcheck-dirty" in test/ for a longer list of borderline cases.

* Also see https://gitlab.com/esr/reposurgeon/issues for two minor problems.

* The pathological-load Hg cases fail, that should be fixed.  They
  succeeded in Python. "make REPOSURGEON=pyreposurgeon hg-regress-patho"
  exhibits correct behavior.
