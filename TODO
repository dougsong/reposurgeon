* Weird combinations of Subversion copy-delete operations can produce
  content-mismatch failures detectable by repotool compare. In the test
  suite, this problem is exhibited by agito.svn, fleetwood.svn, and
  references.svn.

* Propagation of execute permission in Subversion translations seems flawed.

* Some attempt should be made to create marge links when a deletall is followed
  by a directory copy from another branch. (This is what triggers the "mid-branch
  delete" warning, wehich should ideally go away.)

* Can gitspace merges be deduced from svk:merge and svnmerge properties?

* The Subversion dumper is pretty weak, more a proof of concept than
  anything useful for production. Improving it might be useful.
  
* Also see the Gitlab issue tracker for two minor problems.

* It would be nice to restore the toposort code from Python, removed
  not merely because porting it to Go failed but because the attempt
  opened up a can of worms about the operation's nonlocal effects.
