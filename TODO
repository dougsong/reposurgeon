* SVN mergeinfo interpretation needs some work. Present implementation may
  create confusing merge links in some cases.

* Someday, port fully to Python 3.  At that point, reapply the commit
  "Ensure BZ2File only work on binary data".

* The Subversion dumper is pretty weak, more a proof of concept than
  anything useful for production.
