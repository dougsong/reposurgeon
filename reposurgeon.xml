<refsect1 id='description'><title>DESCRIPTION</title>

<para>The purpose of <command>reposurgeon</command> is to enable risky
operations that VCSes (version-control systems) don't want to let you
do, such as (a) editing past comments and metadata, (b) excising
commits, (c) coalescing and splitting commits, (d) removing files and
subtrees from repo history, (e) merging or grafting two or more repos,
and (f) cutting a repo in two by cutting a parent-child link,
preserving the branch structure of both child repos.</para>

<para>The original motivation for <command>reposurgeon</command> was
to clean up artifacts created by repository conversions.  It was
foreseen that the tool would also have applications when code needs to
be removed from repositories for legal or policy reasons.</para>

<para>To keep <command>reposurgeon</command> simple and flexible, it
normally does not do its own repository reading and writing.  Instead, it
relies on being able to parse and emit the command streams created by
git-fast-export and read by git-fast-import.  This means that it can
be used on any version-control system that has both fast-export
and fast-import utilities. The git-import stream format also implicitly
defines a common language of primitive operations for
<command>reposurgeon</command> to speak.</para>

<para>Fully supported systems (those for which
<command>reposurgeon</command> can both read and write repositories)
include git, hg, bzr, svn, and darcs.  For a complete list, with
dependencies and technical notes, type <command>prefer</command> to
the <command>reposurgeon</command> prompt. Also note that writing
Subversion repositories has some significant limitations, discussed in
the section on <link linkend="subversion">Working With
Subversion</link>.</para>

<para>Fossil repository files can be read in using the
<option>--fossil</option> option of the <command>read</command>
command and written out with the <option>--fossil</option> option of
the <command>write</command>. Ignore patterns are not translated
in either direction.</para>

<para>RCS and CVS are supported for read only, not write.  For both,
<command>reposurgeon</command> must be run from within a repository
directory.</para>

<!--
<para>In order to deal with version-control systems that do not have
fast-export equivalents, <command>reposurgeon</command> can also host
extractor code that reads repositories directly.  For each
version-control system supported through an extractor,
<command>reposurgeon</command> uses a small amount of knowledge about
the system's command-line tools to (in effect) replay repository
history into an input stream internally. Repositories under systems
supported through extractors can be read by
<command>reposurgeon</command>, but not modified by it.  In
particular, <command>reposurgeon</command> can be used to move a
repository history from any VCS supported by an extractor to any VCS
supported by a normal importer/exporter pair.</para>

A test extractor exists for git, but is normally disabled in favor of
the regular exporter. A Subversion extractor existed in an unreleased
version of <command>reposurgeon</command>, but due to extremely poor
performance it was discarded in favor of parsing dumpfiles.

Migration HOWTO</ulink>.</para>

<refsect1 id='warning'><title>SAFETY WARNINGS</title>

<para><command>reposurgeon</command> is a sharp enough tool to cut
you.  It takes care not to ever write a repository in an actually
inconsistent state, and will terminate with an error message rather
than proceed when its internal data structures are confused.  However,
there are lots of things you can do with it - like altering stored
commit timestamps to they no longer match the commit sequence - that
are likely to cause havoc after you're done.  Proceed with caution and
check your work.</para>

<para>Also note that, if your DVCS does the usual thing of making
commit IDs a cryptographic hash of content and parent links, editing a
publicly-accessible repository with this tool would be a bad idea. All
of the surgical operations in <command>reposurgeon</command> will
modify the hash chains, meaning others will become unable to pull
from or push to the repo.</para>

<para>Please also see the notes on system-specific issues under <xref
linkend='limitations'/>.</para>

</refsect1>

<refsect1 id='options'><title>OPERATION</title>
<para>The program can be run in one of two modes, either as an
interactive command interpreter or in batch mode to execute commands
given as arguments on the <command>reposurgeon</command> invocation
line. The only differences between these modes are (1) the interactive
one begins by turning on the 'verbose 1' option, (2) in batch mode all
errors (including normally recoverable errors in selection-set syntax)
are fatal, and (3) each command-line argument beginning with
<quote>--</quote> has that stripped off (which, in particular means
that --help and --version will work as expected). Also, in interactive
mode, Ctrl-P and Ctrl-N will be available to scroll through your
command history and tab completion of command keywords is
available.</para>

<para>A git-fast-import stream consists of a sequence of commands
which must be executed in the specified sequence to build the repo; to
avoid confusion with <command>reposurgeon</command> commands
we will refer to the stream commands as <emphasis>events</emphasis> in
this documentation.  These events are implicitly numbered from 1
upwards.  Most commands require specifying a selection of event
sequence numbers so <command>reposurgeon</command> will know
which events to modify or delete.</para>

<para>For all the details of event types and semantics, see the
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>git-fast-import</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
manual page; the rest of this paragraph is a quick start for the
impatient. Most events in a stream are <emphasis
role="bold">commits</emphasis> describing revision states of the
repository; these group together under a single change comment one or
more <emphasis role="bold">fileops</emphasis> (file operations), which
usually point to <emphasis role="bold">blobs</emphasis> that are
revision states of individual files. A fileop may also be a delete
operation indicating that a specified previously-existing file was
deleted as part of the version commit; there are a couple of other
special fileop types of lesser importance.</para>

<para>Commands to <command>reposurgeon</command> consist of a
command keyword, sometimes preceded by a selection set, sometimes
followed by whitespace-separated arguments. It is often possible to
omit the selection-set argument and have it default to something
reasonable.</para>

<para>Here are some motivating examples.  The commands will be
explained in more detail after the description of selection
syntax.</para>

<refsect2 id='selections'><title>SELECTION SYNTAX</title>

<para>The selection-set specification syntax is an expression-oriented
minilanguage.  The most basic term in this language is a
<firstterm>location</firstterm>. The following sorts of primitive locations
are supported:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><firstterm>event numbers</firstterm></term>
<listitem><para>A plain numeric literal is interpreted as a 1-origin
event-sequence number.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><firstterm>marks</firstterm></term>
<listitem><para>A numeric literal preceded by a colon is interpreted
as a mark; see the import stream format documentation for explanation
of the semantics of marks.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><firstterm>tag and branch names</firstterm></term>
<listitem>
<para>The basename of a branch (including branches in the refs/tags
namespace) refers to its tip commit.  The name of a tag is equivalent
to its mark (that of the tag itself, not the commit it refers to). Tag
and branch locations are bracketed with &lt; &gt; (angle brackets) to
distinguish them from command keywords.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><firstterm>fossil IDs</firstterm></term>
<listitem>
<para>If the contents of name brackets (&lt; &gt;) does not match a tag or
branch name, the interpreter next searches fossil IDs of commits.  This
is especially useful when you have imported a Subversion dump; it
means that commits made from it can be referred to by their corresponding
Subversion revision numbers.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><firstterm>$</firstterm></term>
<listitem><para>Refers to the last event.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>These may be grouped into sets in the following ways:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><firstterm>ranges</firstterm></term>
<listitem><para>A range is two locations separated by "..", and is
the set of events beginning at the left-hand location and ending at the
right-hand location (inclusive).</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term><firstterm>lists</firstterm></term>
<listitem><para>Comma-separated lists of locations and ranges are
accepted, with the obvious meaning.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>There are some other ways to construct event sets:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term><firstterm>visibility sets</firstterm></term>
<listitem>
<para>A visibility set is an expression specifying a set of event
types. It will consist of a leading equal sign, followed by type
letters. These are the type letters:</para>

<term><firstterm>paths</firstterm></term>
<listitem>
<para>A "path expression" enclosed in square brackets resolves to the
set of all commits and blobs related to a path matching the given
expression. The path expression itself is either a path literal or a
regular expression surrounded by slashes. Immediately after the
trailing / of a path regexp you can put any number of the following
characters which act as flags: 'a' and 'c'.</para>

<para>By default, a path is related to a commit if the latter has a
fileop that touches that file path - modifies that change it, deletes
that remove it, renames and copies that have it as a source or
target. When the 'c' flag is in use the meaning changes: the paths
related to a commit become all paths that would be present in a
checkout for that commit.</para>

<para>A path literal matches a commit if and only if the path literal is
exactly one of the paths related to the commit (no prefix or suffix operation
is done). In particular a path literal won't match if it corresponds to a
directory in the chosen repository.</para>

<para>A regular expression matches a commit if it matches any path related to
the commit anywhere in the path. You can use '^' or '$' if you want the
expression to only match at the beginning or end of paths.  When the 'a' flag is
in use, the path expression selects commits whose every path match the regular
expression. This is not always a subset of commits selected without the 'a'
flag because it also selects commits with no related paths (e.g. empty commits,
deletealls and commits with empty trees). If you want to avoid those, you can
use e.g. '[/regex/] &amp; [/regex/a]'.</para>

<para>A path or literal matches a blob if it matches any path that
appeared in a modification fileop that referred to that blob. To
select purely matching blobs or matching commits, compose a path
expression with =B or =C.</para>

<para>If you need to embed '[^/]' into your regular expression (e.g. to
express "all characters but a slash") you can use a Python string
escape such as \x2f.</para>

<para>Set expressions may be combined with the operators | and &amp;;
these are, respectively, set union and intersection. The | has lower
precedence than intersection, but you may use parentheses '(' and

curly brackets used in older versions of the syntax).</para>

<para>Any set operation may be followed by '?' to add the set
members' neighbors and referents.  This extends the set to include the
parents and children of all commits in the set, and the referents of
any tags and resets in the set. Each blob reference in the set is
replaced by all commits that refer to it. The '?' can be repeated
to extend the neighborhood depth.</para>

<listitem><para>With a directory-name argument, this command attempts

version-control system under that directory; read with no arguments
does this in the current directory. If output is redirected to a
plain file, it will be read in as a fast-import stream or Subversion
dumpfile. With an argument of <quote>-</quote>, this command reads a
fast-import stream or Subversion dumpfile from standard input (this
will be useful in filters constructed with command-line
arguments).</para>

<para>If the contents is a fast-import stream, any "cvs-revisions" property
on a commit is taken to be a newline-separated list of CVS revision cookies
pointing to the commit, and used for reference lifting.</para>

<para>If the read location is a git repository and contains a

<para>Dump selected events as a fast-import stream representing the

<para>Alternatively, if there is no redirect and the argument names a

selection set being ignored; if that target directory is nonempty its
contents are backed up to a save directory.</para>

<para>If the write location is a file and the <option>--fossil</option>

<para>With the <option>--fossilize</option> option, the Fossil-ID of
each commit is appended to its commit comment at write time. This
option is mainly useful for debugging conversion edge cases.</para>

<para>If you specify a partial selection set such that some commits
are included but their parents are not, the output will include
incremental dump cookies for each branch with an origin outside the
selection set, just before the first reference to that branch in a
commit.  An incremental dump cookie looks like "refs/heads/foo^0" and
is a clue to export-stream loaders that the branch should be glued to
the tip of a pre-existing branch of the same name.  The
<option>--noincremental</option> option suppresses this behavior.</para>

<para>When you specify a partial selection set, including a commit
object forces the inclusion of every blob to which it refers and
every tag that refers to it.</para>

<para>Specifying a partial selection may cause a situation in which
some parent marks in merges don't correspond to commits present in the
dump.  When this happens and <option>--callout</option> optioonm was
specified, the write code replaces the merge mark with a callout, the
action stamp of the parent commit; otherwise the parent mark is
omitted.  Importers will fail when reading a stream dump with callouts;
it is intended to be used by the <command>graft</command>
command.</para>

<para>Specifying a write selection set with gaps in it is allowed
but unlikely to lead to good results if it is loaded by an importer.</para>

<term><command>squash</command>
        [<emphasis>policy...</emphasis>]
</term>
<listitem>
<para>Combine or delete commits in a selection set of events. The
default selection set for this command is empty. Has no effect on
events other than commits unless the --delete policy is selected;
see the 'delete' command for discussion.</para>

<para>Normally, when a commit is squashed, its file operation list
(and any associated blob references) gets either prepended to the
beginning of the operation list of each of the commit's children or
appended to the operation list of each of the commit's parents. Then
children of a deleted commit get it removed from their parent set and
its parents added to their parent set.</para>

<para>The default is to squash forward, modifying children; but see the
list of policy modifiers below for how to change this.</para>

<warning>
<para>It is easy to get the bounds of a squash command wrong, with
confusing and destructive results. Beware thinking you can squash on a
selection set to merge all commits except the last one into the last
one; what you will actually do is to merge all of them to the first
commit <emphasis>after</emphasis> the selected set.</para>
</warning>

<para>Normally, any tag pointing to a combined commit will also be
pushed forward.  But see the list of policy modifiers below for how to
change this.</para>

<para>Following all operation moves, every one of the altered file
operation lists is reduced to a shortest normalized form. The
normalized form detects various combinations of modification,
deletion, and renaming and simplifies the operation sequence as much
as it can without losing any information.</para>

<para>After canonicalization, a file op list may still end up containing
multiple M operations on the same file. Normally the tool utters a
warning when this occurs but does not try to resolve it.</para>

<para>Under any of these policies except <quote>--delete</quote>,
deleting a commit that has children does not back out the changes made
by that commit, as they will still be present in the blobs attached to
versions past the end of the deletion set.  All a delete does when the
commit has children is lose the metadata information about when and by
who those changes were actually made; after the delete any such
changes will be attributed to the first undeleted children of the
deleted commits.  It is expected that this command will be useful
mainly for removing commits mechanically generated by repository
converters such as <command>cvs2svn</command>.</para>

<para>If the repo was named 'foo', you will normally end up with two

connected through another path after the cut, the behavior changes.

paths or Python regular expressions matching paths (regexps must
be marked by being surrounded with //).</para>

<para>All filemodify (M) operations and delete (D) operations
involving a matched file in the selected set of events are
disconnected from the repo and put in a removal set.  Renames are
followed as the tool walks forward in the selection set; each triggers
a warning message. If a selected file is a copy (C) target, the copy
will be deleted and a warning message issued. If a selected file is a
copy source, the copy target will be added to the list of paths to be
deleted and a warning issued.</para>

<para>After file expunges have been performed, any commits with no
remaining file operations will be removed, and any tags pointing to
them. Commits with deleted fileops pointing both in and outside the
path set are not deleted, but are cloned into the removal set.</para>

<para>The removal set is not discarded. It is assembled into a new
repository named after the old one with the suffix "-expunges" added.

<para>In any mode other than --dedos, attempting to specify a
selection set including both blobs and non-blobs (that is, commits or
tags) throws an error. Inline content in commits is filtered when the
selection set contains (only) blobs and the commit is within the range
bounded by the earliest and latest blob in the specification.</para>

<para>When filtering blobs, if the command line contains the magic cookie
'%PATHS%' it is replaced with a space-separated list of all paths
that reference the blob.</para>

<para>With --shell, the remainder of the line specifies a filter as a
shell command. Each blob or comment is presented to the filter on
standard input; the content is replaced with whatever the filter emits
to standard output. At present --shell is required. Other filtering
modes will be supported in the future.</para>

<para>With --regex, the remainder of the line is expected to be a Python
regular expression substitution written as /from/to/ with from and
to being passed as arguments to the standard re.sub() function and
it applied to modify the content. Actually, any non-space character will
work as a delimiter in place of the /; this makes it easier to use
/ in patterns. Ordinarily only the first such
substitution is performed; putting 'g' after the slash replaces
globally, and a numeric literal gives the maximum number
of substitutions to perform. Other flags available restrict substiution
scope - 'c' for comment text only, 'C' for committer name only, 'a'
for author names only.</para>

<para>With --replace, the behavior is like --regexp but the expressions are
not interpreted as regular expressions. (This is slightly
faster).</para>

<para>For a <quote>move</quote>, a third argument must be a singleton
selection set. For a <quote>rename</quote>, the third argument may be
any token that is a syntactically valid tag name (but not the name of
an existing tag). For a <quote>delete</quote>, no third argument is
required.</para>

<para>The behavior of this command is complex because features which
present as tags may be any of three things: (1) True tag objects, (2)
lightweight tags, actually sequences of commits with a common
branchname beginning with <quote>refs/tags</quote> - in this case the
tag is considered to point to the last commit in the sequence, (3)
Reset objects.  These may occur in combination; in fact, stream
exporters from systems with annotation tags commonly express each of
these as a true tag object (1) pointing at the tip commit of a
sequence (2) in which the basename of the common branch field is
identical to the tag name.  An exporter that generates
lightweight-tagged commit sequences (2) may or may not generate resets
pointing at their tip commits.</para>

<para>This command tries to handle all combinations in a natural way by
doing up to three operations on any true tag, commit sequence, and
reset matching the source name. In a rename, all are renamed together.
In a delete, any matching or reset tag is deleted; then matching
branch fields are changed to match the branch of the unique descendent
of the tagged commit, if there is one.  When a tag is moved, no branch
fields are changed and a warning is issued.</para>

<para>Attempts to delete a lightweight tag may fail with the message
<quote>couldn't determine a unique successor</quote>.  When this
happens, the tag is on a commit with multiple children that have
different branch labels. There is a hole in the specification
of git fast-import streams that leaves it uncertain how branch
labels can be safely reassigned in this case; rather than do
something risky, <command>reposurgeon</command> throws a recoverable
error.</para>

<refsect2 id="reference-lifting"><title>REFERENCE LIFTING</title>

<para>This group of commands is meant for fixing up references in commits
that are in the format of older version control systems.  The general
workflow is this: first, go over the comment history and change all
old-fashioned commit references into machine-parseable cookies.  Then,
automatically turn the machine-parseable cookie into action stamps.
The point of dividing the process this way is that the first part is
hard for a machine to get right, while the second part is prone to errors
when a human does it.</para>

<para>A Subversion cookie is a comment substring of the form
[[SVN:ddddd]] (example: [[SVN:2355]] with the revision read directly
via the Subversion exporter, deduced from git-svn metadata, or
matching a $Revision$ header embedded in blob data for the
filename.</para>

<para>A CVS cookie is a comment substring of the form
[[CVS:filename:revision]] (example: [[CVS:src/README:1.23]] with the
revision matching a CVS $Id$ or $Revision$ header embedded in blob
data for the filename.</para>

<para>A mark cookie is of the form [[:dddd]] and is simply a reference
to the specified mark. You may want to hand-patch this in when one of
previous forms is inconvenient.</para>

<para>An action stamp is an RFC3339 timestamp, followed by a '!',
followed by a author email address.  It attempts to refers to a commit
without being VCS-specific.  Thus, instead of "commit 304a53c2" or
"r2355", "2011-10-25T15:11:09Z!fred@foonly.com".</para>

<para>There is a rare case in which an action stamp
will not refer uniquely to one commit. It is theoretically possible
that the same author might check in revisions on different branches
within the one-second resolution of the timestamps in a fast-import stream.
There is nothing to be done about this; tools using action stamps need to be
aware of the possibility and throw a warning when it occurs.</para>

<para>In order to support reference lifting,
<command>reposurgeon</command> internally builds a fossil-reference
map that associates revision identifiers in older version-control
systems with commits.  The contents of this map comes from three
places: (1) cvs2svn:rev properties if the repository was read from a
Subversion dump stream, (2) $Id$ and $Revision$ headers in repository
files, and (3) the <filename>.git/cvs-revisions</filename> created by
<command>git cvsimport</command>.</para>

<para>The detailed sequence for lifting possible references is this: first,
find possible CVS and Subversion references with the
<command>references</command>; then replace them with equivalent
cookies; then run <command>references lift</command> to turn the
cookies into action stamps (using the information in the
fossil-reference map) without having to do the lookup by hand.</para>

<para>With the modifier 'edit', edit the set where revision IDs are

addresses (net-wide identifiers) and complete names. To supply the map
from one to the other, an authors file is expected to consist of
lines each beginning with a local user ID, followed by a '=' (possibly
surrounded by whitespace) followed by a full name and email address,
optionally followed by a timezone offset field.  Thus:</para>

<literallayout>
ferd = Ferd J. Foonly &lt;foonly@foo.com&gt; -0500
</literallayout>

<para>An authors file may have comment lines beginning with '#'; these
are ignored.</para>

<para>When an authors file is applied, email addresses in committer and author
metadata for which the local ID matches between &lt; and @ are replaced
according to the mapping (this handles git-svn lifts). Alternatively,
if the local ID is the entire address, this is also considered a match
(this handles what git-cvsimport and cvs2git do) </para>

<para>With the 'read' modifier, or no modifier, apply author mapping
data (from standard input or a &lt;-redirected file).  May be useful
if you are editing a repo or dump created by
<command>cvs2git</command> or by <command>git-svn</command> invoked
without -A.</para>

<para>With the 'write' modifier, write a mapping file that could be
interpreted by <command>authors read</command>, with entries for each
unique committer, author, and tagger (to standard output or a
&lt;-redirected mapping file). This may be helpful as a start on
building an authors file, though each part to the right of an equals
sign will need editing.</para>

branch name can use backreferences (see the sub function in the Python
documentation).</para>

<para>Note that the regular expressions are appended to 'refs/'

choosing the right kind of branch type.</para>

that the command continues on the next line. Any number of consecutive lines

evaluation. Second, a command that takes an input filename argument can instead
take literal following data in the syntax of a shell here-document. That is: if
the filename is replaced by "&lt;&lt;EOF", all following lines in the script up
to a terminating line consisting only of "EOF" will be read, placed in a
temporary file, and that file fed to the command and afterwards deleted. EOF
may be replaced by any string. Backslashes have no special meaning while

<refsect1 id='subversion'><title>WORKING WITH SUBVERSION</title>

<para><application>reposurgeon</application> can read Subversion

repository, not a checkout directory).  The
<application>reposurgeon</application> distribution includes a script
named <quote>repopuller</quote> that you can use to make and then
incrementally update a local mirror of a remote repository for
editing or conversion purposes.</para>

<refsect2><title>READING SUBVERSION REPOSITORIES</title>

<para>Certain optional modifiers on the read command change
its behavior when reading Subversion repositories:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>--nobranch</term>
<listitem><para>Suppress branch analysis.</para></listitem>

git-svn.  Otherwise, addresses will be the way git cvs-import does
it.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>These modifiers can go anywhere in any order on the read command
line after the read verb. They must be whitespace separated.</para>

<para>Here are the rules used for mapping subdirectories in a
Subversion repository to branches:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>At any given time there is a set of eligible
paths and path wildcards which declare potential branches.
See the documentation of the <command>branchify</command>
for how to alter this set, which initially consists of
{trunk, tags/*, branches/*, and '*'}.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>A repository is considered "flat" if it has no
directory that matches a path or path wildcard in the branchify set.
All commits in a flat repository are assigned to branch master, and
what would have been branch structure becomes directory structure.  In
this case, we're done; all the other rules apply to non-flat
repos.</para>

<para>If you give the option <option>--nobranch</option>
when reading a Subversion repository, branch analysis is skipped and
the repository is treated as though flat (left as a linear sequence of
commits on refs/heads/master).  This may be useful if your repository
configuration is highly unusual and you need to do your own branch
surgery. Note that this option will disable partitioning of mixed
commits.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>If "trunk" is eligible, it always becomes the master
branch.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>If an element of the branchify set ends with *, each
immediate subdirectory of it is considered a potential branch.  If '*'
is in the branchify set (which is true by default) all top-level
directories other than /trunk, /tags, and /branches are also
considered potential branches.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Each potential branch is checked to see if it has
commits on it after the initial creation or copy.  If there are such
commits, it becomes a branch.  If not, it becomes a tag in order to
preserve the commit metadata.  (In all cases, the name of the tag or
branch is the basename of the directory.)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Files in the top-level directory are assigned to a
synthetic branch named 'root'.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>Each commit that only creates or deletes directories (in
particular, copy commits for tags and branches, and commits that only
change properties) will be transformed into a tag named after the
branch, containing the date/author/comment metadata from the
commit. While this produces a desirable result for tags, non-tag
branches (including trunk) will also get root tags this way. This
apparent misfeature has been accepted so that
<application>reposurgeon</application> will never destroy
human-generated metadata that might have value; it is left up to the
user to manually remove unwanted tags.</para>

<para>Subversion branch deletions are turned into deletealls, clearing the
fileset of the import-stream branch.  When a branch
finishes with a deleteall at its tip, the deleteall is transformed
into a tag. This rule cleans up after aborted branch renames.</para>

<para>Occasionally (and usually by mistake) a branchy Subversion
repository will contain revisions that touch multiple branches. These
are handled by partitioning them into multiple import-stream commits,
one on each affected branch. The Fossil-ID of such a split commit
will have a pseudo-decimal part - for example, if Subversion revision 2317
touches three branches, the three generated commits will have IDs
2317.1, 2317.2, and 2317.3.</para>

<para>The svn:executable and svn:special properties are translated
into permission settings in the input stream; svn:executable becomes
100755 and svn:special becomes 120000 (indicating a symlink; the blob
contents will be the path to which the symlink should resolve).</para>

<para>Any cvs2svn:rev properties generated by
<application>cvs2svn</application> are incorporated into the internal map
used for reference-lifting, then discarded.</para>

<para>Per-directory svn:ignore properties become .gitignore files.
Actual .gitignore files in a Subversion directory are presumed to have
been created by git-svn users separately from native Subversion ignore
properties and discarded with a warning. It is up to the user to merge
the content of such files into the target repository by hand.</para>

<para>svn:mergeinfo properties are interpreted.  Any svn:mergeinfo property
on a revision A with a merge source range ending in revision B produces
a merge link such that B becomes a parent of A.</para>

<para>All other Subversion properties are discarded. (This may change in a
future release.) The property for which this is most likely to cause
semantic problems is svn:eol-style. However, since property-change-only
commits get turned into annotated tags, the translated tags will retain
information about setting changes.</para>

<para>The sub-second resolution on Subversion commit dates is discarded;
Git wants integer timestamps only.</para>

<para>Because fast-import format cannot represent an empty directory,
empty directories in Subversion repositories will be lost in
translation.</para>

<para>Normally, Subversion local usernames are mapped in the style of
git cvs-import; thus user "foo" becomes "foo &lt;foo&gt;", which is
sufficient to pacify git and other systems that require email
addresses.  With the option "svn_use_uuid", usernames are mapped in the
git-svn style, with the repository's UUID used as a fake domain in the
email address. Both forms can be remapped to real address using
the <command>authors read</command> command.</para>

<para>Reading a Subversion stream enables writing of the fossil map as
'fossil' passthroughs when the repo is written to a stream
file.</para>

<para><command>reposurgeon</command> tries hard to silently do the
right thing, but there are Subversion edge cases in which it emits warnings
because a human may need to intervene and perform fixups by hand. Here
are the less obvious messages it may emit:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>user-generated .gitignore</term>
<listitem>
<para>This message means means <command>reposurgeon</command> has
found a <filename>.gitignore</filename> file in the Subversion
repository it is analyzing. This probably happened because somebody
was using <command>git-svn</command> as a live gateway, and created
ignores which may or may not be congruent with those in the generated
<filename>.gitignore</filename> files that the Subversion ignore
properties will be translated into.  You'll need to make a policy
decision about which set of ignores to use in the conversion, and
possibly to delete either the generated
<filename>.gitignore</filename> files or the user-created ones.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>can't connect nonempty branch XXXX to origin</term>
<listitem>
<para>This is a serious error. <command>reposurgeon</command> has been

</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>permission information may be lost</term>
<listitem>
<para>A Subversion node change on a file sets or clears properties,
but no ancestor can be found for this file. Executable or symlink
position may be set wrongly on later revisions of this
file. Subversion user-defined properties may also be scrambled or
lost. Usually this error can be ignored.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>properties set</term>
<listitem>
<para><command>reposurgeon</command> has detected a setting of a

svn:externals. These properties cannot be expressed in an import

error can be ignored.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>branch links detected by file ops only</term>
<listitem>
<para>Branch links are normally deduced by examining Subversion directory
copy operations. A common user error (making a branch with a non-Subversion
directory copy and then doing an svn add on the contends) can defeat this.
While <command>reposurgeon</command> should detect and cope with most such
copies correctly, you should examine the commit graph to check that the
branch is rooted at the correct place.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>could not tagify root commit</term>
<listitem>
<para>The earliest commit in your Subversion repository has file operations,

</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>mid-branch deleteall</term>
<listitem>
<para>A deleteall operation has been found in the middle of a branch

created by mistake, and someone later tried to undo the error by
deleting the tag/branch directory before recreating it with a copy
operation.  Examine the topology near the deleteall closely, it may
need hand-hacking. It is fairly likely that both (a) the
<command>reposurgeon</command> translation will be different from what
other translators (such as <command>git-svn</command>) produce,
and (b) it will not be immediately obvious which is right.</para>
</listitem>

<term>couldn't find a branch root for the copy</term>

</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>

changes are preserved but some metadata is unavoidably lost.
Furthermore, writing out a DVCS history in Subversion also loses
significant portions of its metadata.  Details follow.</para>

<para>Writing a Subversion repository or dump stream discards author
information, the committer's name, and the hostname part of the commit
address; only the commit timestamp and the local part of the
committer's email address are preserved, the latter becoming the
Subversion author field.  However, reading a Subversion repository and
writing it out again will preserve the author fields.</para>

<para>Import-stream timestamps have 1-second granularity. The sub-second
parts of Subversion commit timestamps will be lost on their way through
reposurgeon.</para>

<para>Empty directories aren't represented in import
streams. Consequently, reading and writing Subversion repositories
preserves file content, but not empty directories.  It is also not
guaranteed that after editing a Subversion repository that the sequence
of directory creations and deletions relative to other operations will
be identical; the only guarantee is that enclosing directories will
be created before any files in them are.</para>

<para>When reading a Subversion repository,
<application>reposurgeon</application> discards the special
directory-copy nodes associated with branch creations.  These can't be
recreated if and when the repository is written back out to
Subversion; rather, each branch copy node from the original translates
into a branch creation plus the first set of file modifications on the
branch.</para>

<para>When reading a Subversion repository,
<application>reposurgeon</application> also automatically breaks apart
mixed-branch commits. These are not re-united if the repository
is written back out.</para>

<para>When writing to a Subversion repository, all lightweight tags
become Subversion tag copies with empty log comments, named for the
tag basename.  The committer name and timestamp are copied from the
commit the tag points to. The distinction between heads and tags is
lost.</para>

<para>Because of the preceding two points, it is not guaranteed that
even revision numbers will be stable when a Subversion repository
is read in and then written out!</para>

<para>Subversion repositories are always written with a standard
(trunk/tags/branches) layout. Thus, a repository with a nonstandard
shape that has been analyzed by <application>reposurgeon</application>
won't be written out with the same shape.</para>

<para>When writing a Subversion repository, branch merges are
translated into svn:mergeinfo properties in the simplest possible way -
as an svn:mergeinfo property of the translated merge commit listing
the merge source revisions.</para>

<para>Subversion has a concept of "flows"; that is, named segments of
history corresponding to files or directories that are created when the
path is added, cloned when the path is copied, and deleted when the
path is deleted. This information is not preserved in import streams or
the internal representation that <application>reposurgeon</application>
uses.  Thus, after editing, the flow boundaries of a Subversion history
may be arbitrarily changed. </para>

<refsect1 id='ignore'><title>IGNORE PATTERNS</title>

<para><command>reposurgeon</command> recognizes how supported VCSes
represent file ignores (CVS .cvsignore files lurking untranslated in
older Subversion repositories, Subversion ignore properties,
.gitignore/.hgignore/.bzrignore file in other systems) and moves
ignore declarations among these containers on repo input and
output. This will be sufficient if the ignore patterns are exact
filenames.</para>

<para>Translation may not, however, be perfect when the ignore
patterns are Unix glob patterns or regular expressions.  This
compatibility table describes which patterns will translate;
<quote>plain</quote> indicates a plain filename with no
glob or regexp syntax or negation.</para>

<refsect1 id='style'><title>TRANSLATION STYLE</title>

<para>After converting a CVS or SVN repository, check for and remove
$-cookies in the head revision(s) of the files. The full Subversion
set is $Date:, $Revision:, $Author:, $HeadURL and $Id:. CVS uses
$Author:, $Date:, $Header:, $Id:, $Log:, $Revision:, also (rarely)
$Locker:, $Name:, $RCSfile:, $Source:, and $State:.</para>

<para>When you need to specify a commit, use the action-stamp format
that <command>references lift</command> generates when it can resolve
an SVN or CVS reference in a comment. It is best that you
<emphasis>not vary from this format</emphasis>, even in trivial ways
like omitting the 'Z' or changing the 'T' or '!' or ':'. Making action
stamps uniform and machine-parseable will have good consequences for
future repository-browsing tools.</para>

<para>Sometimes, in converting a repository, you may need to insert an
explanatory comment - for example, if metadata has been garbled or
missing and you need to point to that fact. It's helpful for
repository-browsing tools if there is a uniform syntax for this that
is highly unlikely to show up in repository comments.  We recommend
enclosing translation notes in [[ ]].  This has the advantage of being
visually similar to the [ ] traditionally used for editorial comments
in text.</para>

<para>It is good practice to include, in the comment for the root
commit of the repository, a note dating and attributing the conversion
work and explaining these conventions.  Example:</para>

<blockquote>
<para>[[This repository was converted from Subversion to git on 2011-10-24
by Eric S. Raymond &lt;esr@thyrsus.com&gt;.  Here and elsewhere, conversion
notes are enclosed in double square brackets. Junk commits generated
by cvs2svn have been removed, commit references have been mapped into
a uniform VCS-independent syntax, and some comments edited into
summary-plus-continuation form.]]</para>

<refsect1 id='advanced'><title>ADVANCED EXAMPLES</title>

<programlisting>
define lastchange {
@max(=B &amp; [/ChangeLog/] &amp; /{0}/B)? list
}
</programlisting>

<para>List the last commit that refers to a ChangeLog file containing
a specified string. (The trick here is that ? extends the singleton
set consisting of the last eligible ChangeLog blob to its set of
referring commits, and <command>list</command>only notices the
commits.)</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1 id='changes'><title>INCOMPATIBLE LANGUAGE CHANGES</title>

<para>In versions before 3.0, the general command syntax put the
command verb first, then the selection set (if any) then modifiers
(VSO).  It has changed to optional selection set first, then command
verb, then modifiers (SVO). The change made parsing simpler, allowed
abolishing some noise keywords, and recapitulates a successful design
pattern in some other Unix tools - notably
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>sed</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>.</para>

<para>In versions before 3.0, path expressions only matched
commits, not commits and the associated blobs as well. The names
of the <quote>a</quote> and <quote>c</quote> flags were different.</para>

<para>In <command>reposurgeon</command> versions before 3.0, the
delete command had the semantics of squash;  also, the policy flags
did not require a <quote>--</quote> prefix. The <quote>--delete</quote>
flag was named <quote>obliterate</quote>.</para>

<para>In <command>reposurgeon</command> versions before 3.0, read and
write optionally took file arguments rather than requiring redirects
(and the write command never wrote into directories). This was changed
in order to allow these commands to have modifiers. These modifiers
replaced several global options that no longer exist.</para>

<para>In <command>reposurgeon</command> versions before 3.0, the
earliest factor in a unite command always kept its tag and branch
names unaltered. The new rule for resolving name conflicts, giving
priority to the latest factor, produces more natural behavior when
uniting two repositories end to end; the master branch of the second
(later) one keeps its name.</para>

<para>In <command>reposurgeon</command> versions before 3.0, the tagify
command expected policies as trailing arguments to alter its behaviour. The new
syntax uses similarly named options with leading dashes, that can appear
anywhere after the tagify command</para>

<para>In versions before 2.9. the syntax of "authors", "fossils",
"list", and "mailbox_{in|out}" was different. They took plain filename
arguments rather that using redirect &lt; and &gt;.</para>
</refsect1>

<refsect1 id='limitations'><title>LIMITATIONS AND GUARANTEES</title>

<para>Guarantee: In DVCses that use commit hashes, editing with
<command>reposurgeon</command> never changes the hash of a commit
object unless (a) you edit the commit, or (b) it is a descendant of an
edited commit in a VCS that includes parent hashes in the input of a
child object's hash (git and hg both do this).</para>

<para>Guarantee: <command>reposurgeon</command> only requires
main memory proportional to the size of a repository's metadata
history, not its entire content history.</para>

<para>Guarantee: In the worst case, <command>reposurgeon</command>
makes its own copy of every content blob in the repository's history
and thus uses intermediate disk space approximately equal to the size
of a repository's content history. However, when the repository to be
edited is presented as a stream file, <command>reposurgeon</command>
requires no or only very little extra disk space to represent it; the
internal representation of content blobs is a (seek-offset, length)
pair pointing into the stream file.</para>

<para>Guarantee: <command>reposurgeon</command> never modifies
the contents of a repository it reads, nor deletes any repository. The
results of surgery are always expressed in a new repository.</para>

<para>Guarantee: Any line in a fast-import stream that is not a part
of a command <command>reposurgeon</command> parses and
understands will be passed through unaltered.  At present the set of
potential passthroughs is known to include the
<command>progress</command>, the <command>options</command>, and
<command>checkpoint</command> commands as well as comments led by
#.</para>

<para>Guarantee: All <command>reposurgeon</command> operations either
preserve all repository state they are not explicitly told to modify
or warn you when they cannot do so.</para>

<para>Guarantee: <command>reposurgeon</command> handles the bzr
commit-properties extension, correctly passing through property
items including those with embedded newlines. (Such properties
are also editable in the mailbox format.)</para>

<para>Limitation: Because <command>reposurgeon</command>
relies on other programs to generate and interpret the fast-import command
stream, it is subject to bugs in those programs.</para>

<para>Limitation: bzr suffers from deep confusion over whether its
unit of work is a repository or a floating branch that might have been
cloned from a repo or created from scratch, and might or might not be
destined to be merged to a repo one day. Its exporter only works on
branches, but its importer creates repos.  Thus, a rebuild operation
will produce a subdirectory structure that differs from what you
expect.  Look for your content under the subdirectory 'trunk'.</para>

<para>Limitation: under git, signed tags are imported verbatim. However, any
operation that modifies any commit upstream of the target of the
tag will invalidate it.</para>

<para>Limitation: Stock git (at least as of version 1.7.3.2) will choke on
property extension commands. Accordingly, <command>reposurgeon</command>
omits them when rebuilding a repo with git type.</para>

<para>Limitation: While the Subversion read-side support is in good shape,
the write-side support is more of a sketch or proof-of-concept than a
robust implementation;  it only works on very simple cases and does
not round-trip. It may improve in future releases.</para>

<para>Guarantee: As version-control systems add support for the
fast-import format, their repositories will become editable by
<command>reposurgeon</command>.</para>

<refsect1 id='canonicalization'><title>CANONICALIZATION RULES</title>

<para>It is expected that <command>reposurgeon</command> will
be extended with more deletion policies. Policy authors may
need to know more about how a commit's file operation sequence
is reduced to normal form after operations from deleted commits
are prepended to it.</para>

<para>Recall that each commit has a list of file operations, each a M
(modify), D (delete), R (rename), C (copy), or 'deleteall' (delete all
files). Only M operations have associated blobs.  Normally there is
only one M operation per individual file in a commit's operation
list.</para>

<para>To understand how the reduction process works, it's enough to
understand the case where all the operation in the list are working
on the same file. Sublists of operations referring to different
files don't affect each other and reducing them can be thought
of as separate operations.  Also, a "deleteall" acts as a D for
everything and cancels all operations before it in the list. </para>

<para>The reduction process walks through the list from the beginning
looking for adjacent pairs of operations it can compose.  The following table
describes all possible cases and all but one of the reductions.</para>

<refsect1 id='recovery'><title>CRASH RECOVERY</title>

<para>This section will become relevant only if
<command>reposurgeon</command> or something underneath it in the
software and hardware stack crashes while in the middle of writing out
a repository, in particular if the target directory of the rebuild is
your current directory.</para>

<para>The tool has two conflicting objectives. On the one hand, we
never want to risk clobbering a pre-existing repo.  On the other hand,
we want to be able to run this tool in a directory with a repo and
modify it in place.</para>

<para>We resolve this dilemma by playing a game of three-directory monte.</para>

<procedure>
<step><para>First, we build the repo in a freshly-created staging
directory.  If your target directory is named
<filename>/path/to/foo</filename>, the staging directory will be a
peer named <filename>/path/to/foo-stageNNNN</filename>, where NNNN is
a cookie derived from <command>reposurgeon</command>'s process
ID.</para></step>

<step>
<para>We then make an empty backup directory.  This directory will
be named <filename>/path/to/foo.~N~</filename>, where N is incremented
so as not to conflict with any existing backup directories.
<command>reposurgeon</command> never, under any circumstances,
ever deletes a backup directory.</para>

<para>So far, all operations are safe; the worst that can happen up to
this point if the process gets interrupted is that the staging and
backup directories get left behind.</para>
</step>

<step><para>The critical region begins. We first move everything in the
target directory to the backup directory.</para></step>

<step><para>Then we move everything in the staging directory to the
target.</para></step>

<step><para>We finish off by restoring untracked files in the target
directory from the backup directory. That ends the critical
region.</para></step>

ignored.</para>
